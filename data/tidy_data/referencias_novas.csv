Using Heckman's two-step procedure, this study contributes to examine firms' innovation determinants with a framework that clearly distinguishes between the two steps of innovation model innovation propensity (probability of being innovative) and innovation performance (patents and innovation sales). In particular, the moderating effects of industrial characteristics on the relationships between R&D intensity, financial incentives and innovation performance are discussed. The findings show that different industrial characteristics generate different impacts on innovation propensity and innovation performance. Firms in capital intensive industries and relative monopoly industries are more likely to innovate. The findings also show that Direct Government Subsidy does not contribute significantly to improve economical innovation performance of firms and Indirect Government Subsidy on innovative economic performance is easier to be influenced by industry characteristics, which have important potential policy implications to guide innovation activities for Chinese policy makers as well as for Chinese firms.

Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India, with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 20052010. This study examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs.

After a review of previous hypotheses and conventional wisdom, this study proposes an additional explanation and argues that patent subsidy programs implemented by each provincial region have played an important role in the growth of Chinese patenting. This institutional change, taking place at the province-level, has induced an increase in patent propensity among not only firms, universities, and research institutes, but also individuals. Empirical evidence based on publicly available data provides solid support for this argument. It was also found that a larger fraction of applications are granted patent rights since the implementation of such programs, suggesting that reduction in patent application quality may not be a serious concern, unless the criteria used for patent examination have been lowered.

Yet the impact of international research interactions (IRIs) on national innovation performance is ambiguous. In this study patent-based bibliometric indicators are developed to investigate the influence of different types of IRI on innovation performance using bibliometric data covering eight knowledge intensive manufacturing sectors and 32 countries during the 20032008 period. This sector-based approach avoids some of the problems of using patents as innovation indicators, like varying patenting propensities across sectors by comparing the same sectors across countries. In the study a knowledge production function is estimated for each sector, with patents serving as an indicator of knowledge output. The overall results suggest an absence of positive influence of IRI on innovation performance, and sometimes even a negative influence pointing to reversed knowledge flows. But the pattern is nuanced and differs per sector and type of collaboration. For example, interpersonal collaboration has a negative or no effect on innovation performance depending on the sector, and institutional collaboration has no effect on innovation performance. Within MNC collaboration has a positive influence on innovation performance in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors, but a negative effect or no effect in other sectors. Computers are an exceptional sector in that the influence of IRI depends on the absolute size of the sector in the domestic economy. The paper concludes with the theoretical relevance of these findings and some policy implications are also discussed.

Hence, how do different geographical collaboration networks affect the relation between R&D spending and patents? This empirical study, based on a sample of 3101 Spanish firms, suggests that firms that invest in R&D and join national or regional collaboration networks show a stronger patenting propensity than companies that do not join these networks.

BACKGROUND A reliable noninvasive serum marker of IRA patency is desired to permit early identification of patients with a patent IRA after thrombolysis. METHODS We measured myoglobin, CK-MB and cTnI concentrations in sera obtained just before thrombolysis (T0) and 60 min later (T60) in 442 patients given TNK-tPA and who underwent coronary angiography at 60 min. RESULTS Angiography at 60 min showed a patent IRA (TIMI flow grade 2, 3) in 344 and occluded IRA (TIMI flow grade 0, 1) in 98 patients. The median serum T60 concentration, the ratio of the T60 and T0 serum concentration (60-min ratio) and the slope of increase over 60 min for each serum marker were significantly higher in patients with patent arteries compared with patients with occluded arteries. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for diagnosis of occlusion was 0.71, 0.70 and 0.71 for the 60-min ratio of myoglobin, cTnI and CKMB, respectively. The 60-min ratios of 4.0 for myoglobin, 3.3 for CK-MB and 2.0 for cTnI yielded a probability of patency of 90%, 88% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic performance of serum myoglobin, CK-MB and cardiac Tropinin-I (cTnI) 60-min ratios was similar. The probability of a patent IRA was very high (90%) in patients with 60-min myoglobin ratio 4.0, and early invasive interventions to establish IRA patency may not be necessary in this group. Serum marker determinations at baseline and 60-min after thrombolysis may permit rapid triage of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy by ruling out IRA occlusion.

The percutaneous insertion of a stainless steel vascular stent is a novel approach to the management of an extrinsically compressed vein. The objective of this study was to review the results of treating lower extremity edema secondary to a pelvic venous stenosis through the percutaneous insertion of a stainless steel vascular stent. A retrospective review was performed on gynecologic oncology patients who presented with an edematous lower extremity and underwent an evaluation to diagnose proximal venous stenosis. The evaluation included sonography, venography, and balloon angioplasty prior to the percutaneous insertion of a stainless steel vascular stent. If a venous thrombosis was documented, thrombolysis with urokinase was performed prior to evaluation for venous stenosis. Records were reviewed for the etiology of the venous stenosis, the location and type of stent inserted, and the ability of the stent to maintain patency and provide symptomatic relief. Patency was evaluated at 1-week and then at 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals. The probability of vascular stent patency was calculated using life table analysis. Ten patients with cervical (n = 4), corpus (n = 3), ovarian (n = 1), vulvar (n = 1), and vaginal (n = 1) cancer had one or more vascular stents inserted for the treatment of a stenosed pelvic vein. The etiologies of venous stenosis were radiation fibrosis and surgery (n = 5), postoperative fibrosis (n = 3), and metastatic tumor (n = 2).

The median follow-up was 21 months. All patients had subjective resolution of their edematous extremity while the stents were patent. The interval probability of patency of stented veins was greater than 85% at each evaluation interval. Patency was 100% for patients beyond 6 months of follow-up. There were no major complications.

Materials and Methods One hundred four patients with benign biliary disease were treated with surgical (n = 59) or percutaneous (n = 45) techniques followed by intubation with large-caliber silicone stents. Prior to removal of the biliary stents, patients underwent a biliary manometric perfusion test (n = 168) and/or a clinical trial (n = 105) to objectively and subjectively evaluate the treated site for potential long-term patency. The patients were followed up for 187 months, and clinical outcomes were determined. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for three patient groups, including those who (i) passed either test, (ii) failed either test, and (iii) failed either test, were re-treated, and passed either test. Results Final successful treatment outcomes were documented in 47 (92%) surgically and 31 (86%) percutaneously treated patients, respectively (P = .001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves determined the probability of patency at 0, 2, 4, and 6 years after treatment to be 1.0, .96, .78, and .59, respectively, after passing a biliary manometric perfusion test; and 1.0, .91, .78, and .78, respectively, after passing a clinical trial (P > .10). The probability of patency at 4 years after treatment was .45 after failing a biliary manometric perfusion test, and at 6 months was zero after failing a clinical trial (P = .001 and .001, respectively, vs the same test in the passing group). Seventy-nine percent of patients who failed either test required an additional period of repeated stent placement or reoperation. After repeated treatment, the probability of patency at 04 years was .80 and .88, respectively, for the biliary manometric perfusion test and clinical trial (P > .05 and P > .10, respectively, vs same test in the group that passed). Conclusion Patients who initially pass either the biliary manometric perfusion test or clinical trial have a significantly increased probability of patency versus those who fail; however, patients who fail either test and who then receive definitive additional treatment have a similar probability of patency as those who initially pass. Although the log rank test demonstrated the Kaplan-Meier survival curves from the biliary manometric perfusion test and clinical trial not to be significantly different in any of the three groups (ie, passing, failing, re-treated), the biliary manometric perfusion test is recommended over the clinical trial because of its simplicity, immediate results, and predicted cost savings.

The obtained results indicate that patents with a first non-US original applicant have less probability of being traded and show a longer time to transaction than US first priority patents. We also find that more science-based patents, which are usually characterized by a higher technological uncertainty, are more likely to be traded, but are much less likely to be involved in cross-border deals.

Materials and Methods During a 58-month period, 23 patients underwent 34 outpatient guide wire directed manipulations of their CAPD catheter to improve function (n = 30) or reduce pain and improve function (n = 4) during dialysis. Catheter patency rates were subsequently determined by review of departmental, hospital, and dialysis center charts; procedural reports; and patient telephone interviews. Results Among 12 patients who underwent a single guide wire directed manipulation, long-term (> 30 days) catheter patency was achieved in seven (58%). With use of the Kaplan-Meier survival method, the 3-, 6-, and 12-month probability of patency after a single guide wire manipulation was 0.61, 0.54, and 0.11, respectively. The mean duration of patency achieved in this group was 131 days (range, 2421 days). In those patients (n = 8) who underwent multiple catheter manipulations (n = 19), 11 (58%) procedures resulted in long-term patency, with each patient (100%) achieving at least one such period. The Kaplan-Meier survival method determined the probability of patency in this group at 3, 6, and 12 months to be 0.75, 0.69, and 0.54, respectively.

"43";"Blazsek_2010_JoofEc";"During the past two decades, innovations protected by patents have played a key role in business strategies. This fact enhanced studies of the determinants of patents and the impact of patents on innovation and competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantages is as important as creating them. Patents help sustaining competitive advantages by increasing the production cost of competitors, by signaling a better quality of products and by serving as barriers to entry. If patents are rewards for innovation, more R&D should be reflected in more patent applications but this is not the end of the story. There is empirical evidence showing that patents through time are becoming easier to get and more valuable to the firm due to increasing damage awards from infringers. These facts question the constant and static nature of the relationship between R&D and patents. Furthermore, innovation creates important knowledge spillovers due to its imperfect appropriability. Our paper investigates these dynamic effects using US patent data from 1979 to 2000 with alternative model specifications for patent counts. We introduce a general dynamic count panel data model with dynamic observable and unobservable spillovers, which encompasses previous models, is able to control for the endogeneity of R&D and therefore can be consistently estimated by maximum likelihood. Apart from allowing for firm specific fixed and random effects, we introduce a common unobserved component, or secret stock of knowledge, that affects differently the propensity to patent of each firm across sectors due to their different absorptive capacity.

This fact enhanced studies of the determinants of patents and the impact of patents on innovation and competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantages is as important as creating them. Patents help sustaining competitive advantages by increasing the production cost of competitors, by signaling a better quality of products and by serving as barriers to entry. If patents are rewards for innovation, more R&D should be reflected in more patent applications but this is not the end of the story.

Over the period 1963 1974, the domestic patent base, measured by the number of patent applications filed by nationals in their home countries, has shown little change in any country except for Japan.

In particular, SMEs can be expected to benefit less from patenting activities in terms of protection against imitators than large firms. On the other hand, the propensity and ability of SMEs to license out their patents and generate additional revenue streams might be relatively higher than that of their large counterparts.

Contrary to expectations, this study demonstrates that not only large firms, but also SMEs benefit from patenting in terms of commercializing product innovations. Moreover, for both SMEs and large firms, such increased innovation performance in turn contributes to higher profit margins. Patenting activities also increase the ability of SMEs and large firms to license out knowledge to external parties, and this positive effect is significantly stronger for large firms.

Patenting brings to light the research activities created through university-industry collaborations. This paper explores patent propensity, as related to commercializing innovative activities resulting from collaborations between universities and regional small and medium enterprises (SMEs). To achieve our aims, we apply a robust regression analysis to test five research hypotheses using firm-level data on 263 firms located in the Gwangju region of Korea. Our empirical results show that certain industry characteristics are negatively related to the propensity to patent. In addition, and contrary to expectations, it is found that the InnoBiz firms that the government designated as innovative SMEs are not performing any differently from general firms. It is only the CEO's academic credentials that are found to be positively related to propensity to patent. From the findings, we can conclude that patenting propensity is likely related to CEOs' managerial strategies rather than the particular characteristics of the technology in question.

One implication that emerged from the analysis is that a small firm can counteract its size disadvantage in patenting by introducing a well-developed reward mechanism. 2010 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.";"Innovation surveys and Patent propensity and Reward mechanism and Science park";"";"JOUR";"Yang, D. and Li, X. and Chen, J.";"";"China and World Economy";"2010";"18";"1";"116";"99";"10.1111/j.1749-124X.2010.01183.x";"English";"../../data/raw_data/scopus_patent_propensity.ris"

To overcome this limitation, it is crucial to compare citations by applicants and by examiners in depth, with diverse perspectives and data, to determine the value of patent information for technological innovation. Thus, this paper suggests that the differences in the composition of technical information and patent quality in patent-level investigations as well as the locus of the knowledge source and knowledge recentness in knowledge-level investigations according to patent citation type (by applicants and examiners) reflect Pavitts perspective on the nature, impact, and source of technological innovation. We found that the quality of patents cited by applicants is higher than that of those by examiners in four industries, excluding a supplier-dominated industry. The citation types are related to the locus of the knowledge source in four industries, excluding the supplier-dominated industry.

"96";"Elhauge_2012_TexLawRev";"Courts and commentators are sharply divided about how to assess ""reverse payment"" patent settlements under antitrust law. The essential problem is that a PTO-issued patent provides only a probabilistic indication that courts would hold that the patent is actually valid and infringed, and parties have incentives to structure reverse payment settlements to exclude entry for longer than this patent probability would merit. Some favor comparing the settlement exclusion period to the expected litigation exclusion period, but this requires difficult case-bycase assessments of the probabilities of patent victory. Others instead favor a formal ""scope of the patent"" test that allows such settlements for nonsham patents if the settlement does not delay entry beyond the patent term, preclude noninfringing products, or delay nonsettling entrants. However, the formal scope of the patent test excludes entry for longer than merited by the patent strength, and it provides no solution when there is either a significant dispute about infringement or a bottleneck issue delaying other entrants. This Article provides a way out of this dilemma. It proves that when the reverse payment amount exceeds the patent holder's anticipated litigation costs, then under standard conditions the settlement will, according to the patent holder's own probability estimate, exclude entry for longer than both the expected litigation exclusion period and the optimal patent exclusion period, and thus will both harm consumer welfare and undermine optimal innovation incentives. Further, whenever a reverse payment is necessary for settlement, it will also have those same anticompetitive effects according to the entrant's probability estimate. This proof thus provides an easily administrable way to determine when a reverse payment settlement is necessarily anticompetitive, without requiring any probabilistic inquiry into the patent merits. We also show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, patent settlements without any reverse payment usually (but not always) exceed both the expected litigation exclusion period and the optimal patent exclusion period, and we suggest a procedural solution to resolve such cases.

Our semiparametric specification clearly finds considerable non-linearities in the effect of various metrical covariates which has been not been discussed previously. Further, a formal model validation based on ROC-methodology which splits the data in a training and a validation data set shows a significant improvement of the explanatory and the predictive power of our approach compared to purely parametric specifications.

Although, historically, a great deal of the research evaluating the impact of science has relied on the study of patents (1, 2), this is not the case in food safety. Experts participating in the workshop entitled Assessing the Public Value of Government-Funded University-Based Research on Food Safety, described in Chapter 2, pointed out that patents are not the primary output of food safety research and development; hence the goals of this chapter are limited to addressing the following questions (1) What has happened to the pace and direction of patenting in the food safety sector? (2) What are the characteristics of US and foreign firms that are most active in food safety patenting? (3) What are the geographical and sectoral distribution of food safety patents? This chapter provides new ways of answering these questions for two reasons. The first is the use of a new data set from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that provides detailed information about patents, inventors, and firms. The second is the application of the text analysis techniques discussed in Chapter 4 to patent data these techniques permit the identification of food safety patents in the same way that food safety awards were identified in earlier chapters. Background Although patents are widely used as a measure of innovation, they are not a perfect indicator for a number of reasons. All innovations are not necessarily patented, and patents do not necessarily lead to the commercialization of a product or process. There are variations in the propensity to patent across firms and sectors due to different market sizes and examination processes. A company could be strategically reluctant to file patent applications because it wants to hide its activities from its competitors. Once the technology has matured enough to dominate its competitors, the company may at that point file patent applications. Given that the food safety industry spans a wide variety of sectors, the importance of patents could also vary depending on a firm's need to protect itself against imitators.

The conclusions indicate that both the innovation effort of a company and the degree of codification of the innovations have a positive influence on this propensity, and that this influence is greater in some sectors of activity and also is greater for product and radical innovations. 2013 by the American Society for Engineering Management.";"Appropriability and Innovation and Knowledge Protection and Patents and R&D Management and Engineering and Innovation and Management and Appropriability and Decision framework and Engineering management and Knowledge protection and Patents and Process Innovation and Radical innovation and Patents and inventions";"";"JOUR";"Prez-Cano, C. and Villn-Altamirano, J.";"";"EMJ - Engineering Management Journal";"2013";"25";"3";"27";"38";"10.1080/10429247.2013.11431980";"English";"../../data/raw_data/scopus_propensity_to_patent.ris"

Our study records how brewery innovators pursued a wide variety of highly distinct appropriability strategies, including secrecy, selective revealing, open innovation and knowledge-sharing for reputational reasons, and patenting. All these strategies could co-exist, although some brewery insiders maintained a suspicion of the promoters of patent technologies, which faded only in the nineteenth century.

Economists have used patents as the measure of research and development (R&D) output, partly because they are easier to delineate than other indicators. Behavioral researchers interested in the R&D management process have relied on publications as a surrogate measure for R&D output, while research in science policy and innovation has focused on products and processes as indicators of innovation and technical output. There has not been any consensus about the validity of the different measures. It has been argued that the propensity to patent differs from industry to industry. The incentive to patent is dependent on how well patent can be used to protect the interests of the firms. This paper has focused on all three measures as indicators of R&D output and investigated the interrelationship among them as well as the correlates for these output. Except for the chemical industry, R&D expenditure is closely related with size as measured by annual sales, rather than the net income. It is observed that a growing firm is more likely to spend proportionately more money in R&D. The three output measures, patents, papers, and new products, are correlated, but the pattern of relationship is different in different industries. This means that technical behavior of the firms in different industries differs significantly. Correlates of patents, papers, and new products also differ in the different industries. It is interesting to note that a firm's growth is linked with new products in only some industries. Patent does not seem to have any effect on sales growth. The growth in R&D is not a factor leading to a higher level of scientific productivity. The important factor is the average level of R&D spending. The policy implication for this observation is that one ought to maintain a steady funding level of R&D instead of sudden changes in R&D budget.

Consistency in R&D is important in determining higher level of scientific output. 1990 IEEE";"Industrial Management and Patents and Inventions and High Tech Industries and R&D Management and Engineering Research";"";"JOUR";"Chakrabarti, A.K.";"";"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management";"1990";"37";"1";"48";"52";"10.1109/17.45268";"English";"../../data/raw_data/scopus_propensity_to_patent.ris"

New technology ventures (NTVs) can have positive effects on employment and could rejuvenate industries with disruptive technologies. However, NTVs have a limited survival rate. In our most recent empirical study of 11,259 NTVs established between 1991 and 2000 in the United States, we found that after four years only 36 percent, or 4,062, of companies with more than five full-time employees, had survived. After five years, the survival rate fell to 21.9 percent, leaving only 2,471 firms still in operation with more than five full-time employees. Thus, it is important to examine how new technology ventures can better survive. In the academic literature, a number of studies focus on success factors for NTVs. Unfortunately, empirical results are often controversial and fragmented. To get a more integrated picture of what factors lead to the success or failure of new technology ventures, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the success factors in NTVs.
