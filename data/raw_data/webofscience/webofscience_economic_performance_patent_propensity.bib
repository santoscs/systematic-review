Abstract = {{This research aims to understand how industrial characteristics in
   Chinese industrial sectors are related to and affect innovation
   activities. Using Heckman's two-step procedure, this study contributes
   to examine firms' innovation determinants with a framework that clearly
   distinguishes between the two steps of innovation model: innovation
   propensity (probability of being innovative) and innovation performance
   (patents and innovation sales). In particular, the moderating effects of
   industrial characteristics on the relationships between R\&D intensity,
   financial incentives and innovation performance are discussed. The
   findings show that different industrial characteristics generate
   different impacts on innovation propensity and innovation performance.
   Firms in capital intensive industries and relative monopoly industries
   are more likely to innovate. The findings also show that Direct
   Government Subsidy does not contribute significantly to improve
   economical innovation performance of firms and Indirect Government
   Subsidy on innovative economic performance is easier to be influenced by
   industry characteristics, which have important potential policy
   implications to guide innovation activities for Chinese policy makers as
   well as for Chinese firms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper posits that corporate and technological diversification of
   firms and their relatedness in terms of products and technologies will
   impact their propensity to form technological alliances. It argues that
   both higher levels of diversification and greater relatedness signal
   superior capabilities and available resources to prospective partners
   that will facilitate exploration and exploitation of technological
   assets in an alliance. These theoretical conjectures are tested using a
   dataset of all tire producers worldwide between 1985 and 1996 that
   combines detailed firm data on establishment, patenting, and alliance
   activities. The results indicate that complementarity in terms of
   corporate and technological diversification strategies, as well as
   partner characteristics (e.g., size, age, and technological
   capabilities) drive exploitation alliances. Moreover, firms with similar
   product portfolios are more likely to engage in exploitative
   interactions. In contrast, exploration alliances exhibit strong partner
   similarity across all firm characteristics. Both corporate and
   technological diversification have positive effects on firms' propensity
   to engage in exploration, while technological distance has a negative
   nonlinear one. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Do new school types focusing on practical and business-related knowledge
   lead to increased economic performance? To analyse this question, this
   article examines the introduction of two types of modern secondary
   education, the Gewerbeschule and its successor, the Realschule, in
   nineteenth-century Bavaria. Since the opening of these schools is
   arguably endogenous-as it was mainly the large, prosperous cities that
   opened one-the estimated treatment effect capturing the economic
   influence of the Gewerbeschule/Realschule will lead to biased results.
   To alleviate this bias, propensity score matching is adopted to compare
   relatively similar counties with and without these schools. Using
   historical county-level data on tax revenues, business formations,
   employment structure, and patent holdings, ordinary least squares
   regression analysis shows that the opening of a modern secondary school
   is in general positively associated with economic performance several
   years later.}},

Title = {{An effect analysis of regional research and development support
   policies: focused on Gyeongbuk province in Korea}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{320-342}},
Abstract = {{Regional industry policies, including regional research and development
   (R\&D) policies, have been initiated since 1998 in Korea. Despite the
   need for performance evaluation, the evaluation studies of the regional
   R\&D support policies are lacking. This study analyses the effect of
   regional R\&D support policies on firm's innovative and economic
   performance, focusing on Gyeongbuk province and adopting the propensity
   score matching (PSM) method to deal with the problem of selection bias.
   The characteristics that influence the participation of the firm in the
   regional R\&D support were analysed as age, R\&D department, exports,
   and the electronics/information appliances industry. The government
   needs to encourage the firms to have an absorptive capacity by
   establishing R\&D departments. Regional R\&D support was analysed to
   have no significant effects on the commercialization of developed
   technology, patent applications, new employees, and sales of new
   products. Though the effect is not statistically significant, it is
   nonetheless not meaningless, considering the short elapsed time. We can
   expect that the performance will improve in the future considering the
   fact that the outputs of the R\&D programmes are generated over many
   years. The regional R\&D support policies are expected to contribute to
   strengthening the regional innovation system by improving the regional
   firms' innovative capacity in the long term. By adopting the PSM method,
   the study could potentially eliminate estimation error resulting from
   the simple comparison between the treatment group and the control group.
   It is necessary to take special note of the design of the survey in
   order to adopt the PSM method.}},
