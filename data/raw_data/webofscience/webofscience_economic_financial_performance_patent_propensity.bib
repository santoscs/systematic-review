Abstract = {{What motivates university scientists to identify practical applications
   for their research results and consider having them patent-protected? A
   wealth of research points towards a complex blend of factors, including
   organizational antecedents, social norms and personal-level
   expectations. Few studies, however, have attempted to investigate the
   effect of concrete incentives from the perspective of individual
   scientists' decision-making. In this paper, we operationalize the
   propensity to patent and commercialize research results as the intention
   to submit an invention disclosure filing. We use scenario-based conjoint
   analysis to capture university scientists' preference structures for
   different incentive policies. Results indicate that direct and indirect
   financial incentives are dominant drivers. In addition, a grace period
   that would allow for patenting and publishing in parallel and the
   inclusion of patents in academic performance assessments are worth
   considering, whereas the specific setup of the technology transfer
   organization and public recognition of achievements in form of an award
   appear to have limited effect. However, preferences for incentives and
   hence their effectiveness vary significantly across academic disciplines
   and ranks as well as with scientists' working experience, patenting
   experience and research orientation. On this basis, we can derive more
   qualified recommendations for incentive system design.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims to understand how industrial characteristics in
   Chinese industrial sectors are related to and affect innovation
   activities. Using Heckman's two-step procedure, this study contributes
   to examine firms' innovation determinants with a framework that clearly
   distinguishes between the two steps of innovation model: innovation
   propensity (probability of being innovative) and innovation performance
   (patents and innovation sales). In particular, the moderating effects of
   industrial characteristics on the relationships between R\&D intensity,
   financial incentives and innovation performance are discussed. The
   findings show that different industrial characteristics generate
   different impacts on innovation propensity and innovation performance.
   Firms in capital intensive industries and relative monopoly industries
   are more likely to innovate. The findings also show that Direct
   Government Subsidy does not contribute significantly to improve
   economical innovation performance of firms and Indirect Government
   Subsidy on innovative economic performance is easier to be influenced by
   industry characteristics, which have important potential policy
   implications to guide innovation activities for Chinese policy makers as
   well as for Chinese firms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Value chain analysis can expose strategic and operational misalignments
   within chains, and the consequential misallocation of resources, and
   hence opportunities for improvements which create value and economic
   sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to study how strong is the
   university-firm cooperation influence on firm value chains and how can
   this cooperation influence firm and university innovation and
   performance. The empirical analysis is based on data gathered through a
   questionnaire administered to a sample of Slovak SMEs operated in the
   area of ICT. The findings show that only contractual university-firm
   relationships have a direct and significant effect on innovation,
   whereas relational activities promote and support contractual
   activities. The findings have managerial implications not just for
   firms, but also for universities.
   University-firm relationships contribute to regional and global
   development, because they foster innovation processes regarding firms'
   strategies at those. In this liaison, universities' role usually is to
   promote knowledge-based economic development, which is basic for
   sustainable economic growt. The higher education institutions are facing
   an increasingly competitive environment with growing financial
   constraints, universities are strongly motivated to engage more actively
   with the firm, so as to establish new funding streams and secure
   additional research investment. This relationship should be beneficial
   for both firms and universities.
   Innovative firms are constantly searching for new ways to internalize
   external knowledge into their production function. With this aim, firms
   have found that the university-firm cooperation is a valuable mechanism
   to access to new technological resources, which can contribute to faster
   development of innovation, improved market access, economies of scale
   and scope, and cost sharing and risk spreading In this context,
   universities have been recognized as a capable research partner for
   solving R\&D problems and as advisers on technology strategies and by
   supporting the technology generation and/or the adoption of a new
   technology. Moreover, the cooperation with universities has been
   characterized by the timely appropriation of very-new technological
   opportunities and by the increment on the innovation sales, as well as
   the increase in the propensity to apply for patents.
   Several empirical studies have attempted to identify the factors
   determining the university-firm cooperation in innovation activities,
   concluding that this type of cooperation is based on the complementarity
   on the innovation processes, and on the uncertainty level of the
   innovation results. On the other hand, and based on a firm level
   analysis, some authors concluded that university-firm cooperation
   depends on the firm's absorptive capacity, on its innovative capacity,
   on its proximity to fundamental research, and in some firm-specific
   characteristics, like size and industrial affiliation.}},

   technology companies}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{276-296}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine how different
   innovation patterns affect the financial performance of global
   technological firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors integrate the theories of
   innovation performance with those of Schumpeter's innovation patterns,
   namely, creative destruction and creative accumulation. Data spread over
   20 years is used to investigate the influence of innovation on the firm
   performance.
   Findings - Panel regression results indicate that, as compared to
   creative-destruction innovation, creative-accumulation patterns have a
   better firm performance, have a moderating effect on
   innovation-performance relationships, and have a better propensity to
   deal with difficult economic periods.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a scarcity of research that
   considers the effects of Schumpeterian patterns on innovation
   performance, especially ones dealing with the technology sector. Future
   work could consider other innovation variables (besides innovation
   patterns), as well as whether the results hold in other sectors.
   Practical implications - The findings indicate that in the tech-sector
   firms must continue to innovate.
   Originality/value - From the research perspective, the work integrates
   two streams of literature into a comprehensive model, and provides a
   holistic test for it. For tech-sector managers, the research provides
   one point of motivation for carrying out innovation even during a
   troubled economy.}},

Abstract = {{Technology entrepreneurship is key to economic development. New
   technology ventures (NTVs) can have positive effects on employment and
   could rejuvenate industries with disruptive technologies. However, NTVs
   have a limited survival rate. In our most recent empirical study of
   11,259 NTVs established between 1991 and 2000 in the United States, we
   found that after four years only 36 percent, or 4,062, of companies with
   more than five full-time employees, had survived. After five years, the
   survival rate fell to 21.9 percent, leaving only 2,471 firms still in
   operation with more than five full-time employees. Thus, it is important
   to examine how new technology ventures can better survive. In the
   academic literature, a number of studies focus on success factors for
   NTVs. Unfortunately, empirical results are often controversial and
   fragmented. To get a more integrated picture of what factors lead to the
   success or failure of new technology ventures, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to examine the success factors in NTVs. We culled the
   academic literature to collect data from existing empirical studies.
   Using Pearson correlations as effect size statistics, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to analyze the findings of 31 studies and identified the
   24 most widely researched success factors for NTVs. After correcting for
   artifacts and sample size effects, we found that among the 24 possible
   success factors identified in the literature, 8 are homogeneous
   significant success factors for NTVs (i.e., they are homogeneous
   positive significant metafactors that are correlated to venture
   performance): (1) supply chain integration; (2) market scope; (3) firm
   age; (4) size of founding team; (5) financial resources; (6) founders'
   marketing experience; (7) founders' industry experience; and (8)
   existence of patent protection. Of the original 24 success factors, 5
   were not significant: (1) founders' research and development (R\&D)
   experience; (2) founders' experience with start-ups; (3) environmental
   dynamism; (4) environmental heterogeneity; and (5) competition
   intensity. The remaining 11 success factors are heterogeneous. For those
   heterogeneous success factors, we conducted a moderator analysis. Of
   this set, three appeared to be success factors, and two were failure
   factors for subgroups within the NTVs' population. To facilitate the
   development of a body of knowledge in technology entrepreneurship, this
   study also identifies high-quality measurement scales for future
   research. The article concludes with future research directions.}},
