Abstract = {{The process of technology commercialization involves numerous hurdles,
   from the original idea to its translation into the market. Patenting
   brings to light the research activities created through
   university-industry collaborations. This paper explores patent
   propensity, as related to commercializing innovative activities
   resulting from collaborations between universities and regional small
   and medium enterprises (SMEs). To achieve our aims, we apply a robust
   regression analysis to test five research hypotheses using firm-level
   data on 263 firms located in the Gwangju region of Korea. Our empirical
   results show that certain industry characteristics are negatively
   related to the propensity to patent. In addition, and contrary to
   expectations, it is found that the InnoBiz firms that the government
   designated as innovative SMEs are not performing any differently from
   general firms. It is only the CEO's academic credentials that are found
   to be positively related to propensity to patent. From the findings, we
   can conclude that patenting propensity is likely related to CEOs'
   managerial strategies rather than the particular characteristics of the
   technology in question. We also suggest new technology commercialization
   related with universities' policies and support to promote regional SMEs
   including conglomerated firms as well as universities.}},

Title = {{Patents as proxy for measuring innovations: A case of changing patent
   filing behavior in Indian public funded research organizations}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{181-190}},

Abstract = {{The process of innovation is crucial and essential part of economic
   growth. Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be
   an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form
   an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing
   national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes
   in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and
   patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for
   measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent
   filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use
   of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India,
   with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied
   advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were
   collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 2005-2010. This study
   examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various
   motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative
   Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these
   patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed
   that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results
   connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed
   patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs. Based on our
   results we also derive some policy and decision making implications for
   public research particularly in the context of transition economies. (C)

   Results of an empirical investigation}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{1226-1247}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Considering that SMEs are widely recognized as important
   innovators and, in the past years, have registered increasing levels of
   patenting, the purpose of this paper is to unveil the impact of both
   internal and external knowledge sourcing on SME patenting performance
   and test the moderating role of formal plan for innovation and
   absorptive capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose an econometric
   approach based on a Hurdle Count Data Model which allows the authors not
   only to overcome problems related to the count dependent variables often
   assuming zero values, but also to separate patent propensity from patent
   portfolio size.
   Findings - This methodology puts in evidence that an internal factor
   (i.e. employee skills for innovation) significantly influences SME
   patent propensity, while an external factor (i.e. open innovation with
   business partners) impacts SME portfolio size. Moreover, both formal
   plan for innovation and absorptive capacity play an important moderating
   role.
   Originality/value - This paper embraces a knowledge perspective to
   investigate the determinants of SME patenting, which contributes to the
   knowledge-based view of the firm in the SME domain. Moreover,
   differently from most studies in the area of patenting which adopt a
   macro-level perspective and rely on secondary data, it assumes a
   firm-level approach and bases on primary data, which contributes to make
   it particularly distinctive.}},

Abstract = {{Recent accounts suggest the development and commercialization of
   invention has become more ``open.{''} Greater division of labor between
   inventors and innovators can enhance social welfare through gains from
   trade and economies of specialization. Moreover, this extensive reliance
   upon outside sources for invention also suggests that understanding the
   factors that condition the extramural supply of inventions to innovators
   is crucial to understanding the determinants of the rate and direction
   of innovative activity.
   This paper reports on a recent survey of over 5000 American
   manufacturing sector firms on the extent to which innovators rely upon
   external sources of invention. Our results indicate that, between 2007
   and 2009, 16\% of manufacturing firms had innovated-meaning had
   introduced a product that was new to the industry. Of these, 49\% report
   that their most important new product had originated from an outside
   source, notably customers, suppliers and technology specialists (i.e.,
   universities, independent inventors and R\&D contractors). We also
   compare the contribution of each source to innovation in the US economy.
   Although customers are the most common outside source, inventions
   acquired from technology specialists tend to be the more economically
   significant in term of their gross commercial value. As a group,
   external sources of invention make a significant contribution to the
   overall rate of innovation in the economy. Innovation policies, both
   public and private, should pay careful attention to the external supply
   of invention, and the efficiency of the mechanisms affecting the
   relationships between inventors and innovators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper tries to find how firms use IPRs in the form of patents to
   protect innovation capital and find determinants of their effectiveness.
   The research is based on a large sample of 2960 Polish manufacturing
   firms that were engaged in developing and/or implementing a product or
   process innovation in the years 2010-2012. Besides descriptive
   statistics which show firms' attitudes toward the effectiveness of
   patents and their determinants, I apply the knowledge production
   function to find a link between patent propensity, R\&D and innovation
   performance. Descriptive analyses show that Polish manufacturing firms
   rarely use patents as the appropriability mechanism, which results in
   the low level of their perceived effectiveness. It also turns out that
   the perceived effectiveness of a patent depends on a firm's size, the
   innovation type and technological opportunities. In turn, the results of
   the knowledge production function estimation allow me to conclude that
   an increase in patent propensity affects the firm's innovation
   performance positively.}},

Abstract = {{Patent systems have been established as an incentive for innovation in
   most countries of the world. However, small and medium enterprises
   (SMEs) typically have little experience and expertise in using such
   systems. This paper examines the impact of Japanese patent infringement
   litigation on the subsequent patenting behavior of plaintiff SMEs. Our
   results show that SMEs tend to file lower numbers of patent applications
   but gain stronger patent rights after experiencing patent infringement
   litigation as plaintiffs. This suggests that SMEs learn to manage their
   patent applications after experiencing patent litigation as plaintiffs.
   Furthermore, we also find that the high costs to of patent litigation
   lead to a subsequent decrease in both patent application counts and the
   maximum number of forward citations of granted patents after litigation.
   This suggests that the high costs of patent litigation impose such a
   great burden on plaintiff SMEs that their regular research and
   development (R\&D) activities are negatively impacted.}},

Abstract = {{Why do large firms disclose patentable inventions defensively? We study
   IBM's disclosure and patenting activity and find that stronger antitrust
   enforcement and consent decrees limiting patent protection lead to more
   defensive disclosure. We extend our analysis to Xerox and show, using a
   differences-in-differences approach, a decline in patent propensity and
   an increase in patent scope in patent classes affected by the 1975
   consent decree. We extend our analysis to include AT\&T, the other
   exceptionally large firm with defensive-disclosure activity, and show
   that their patenting propensity declined under increased antitrust
   enforcement relative to other firms in the industry. Overall, we show
   how these firms used defensive disclosure as a strategy to balance the
   benefits of patenting with the costs of uncertain antitrust enforcement.
   Our results are especially relevant in light of the defensive patent
   strategies many firms employ to preempt and cope with patent litigation.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that not all innovations are patented, but the exact
   volume of innovative activities undertaken outside the coverage of
   patent protection and, relatedly, the actual propensity to patent an
   innovation in different contexts remain, to a major degree, a matter of
   speculation. This paper presents an exploratory study comparing
   systematically patented and unpatented innovations over the period
   1977-2004 across industrial sectors. The main data source is the `R\&D
   100 Awards' competition organized by the journal Research and
   Development. Since 1963, the magazine has been awarding this prize to
   the 100 most technologically significant new products available for sale
   or licensing in the year preceding the judgments. We match the products
   winners of the R\&D 100 awards competition with USPTO patents and we
   examine the variation of patent propensity across different contexts
   (industries, geographical areas and organizations). Finally we compare
   our findings with previous assessments of patent propensity based on
   several sources of data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a quality index for patent systems. The index is
   composed of nine operational design components that shape the
   transparency and stringency of patent systems and affect the extent to
   which they comply with patentability conditions. Seven components are
   related to rules and regulations (e.g., grace period, opposition process
   and continuation-in-parts), while two components measure patent offices'
   resource allocation policy (i.e., workload per examiner and incentives).
   The index is computed for 32 national patent systems, and displays a
   high degree of heterogeneity across countries. Cross-sectional
   quantitative analyses suggest that the demand for patent rights is lower
   in patent systems with a higher quality index, controlling for research
   efforts, patent fees and the ``strength{''} of enforcement mechanisms.
   These results have important policy and research (metrics) implications.

Abstract = {{Managers make a number of strategic choices when trying to capture
   returns from innovation investments, including what appropriation
   strategy to use and whether or not to patent, strategic choices that
   depend among other things on firm size. Previous literature, being
   reviewed in this paper, shows that the patent propensity is lower in
   small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than in large firms and that
   patenting as means for appropriation is of less importance among SMEs.
   Chief executive officers (CEOs) and/or research and development (R\&D)
   managers of 26 entrepreneurial SMEs have been interviewed to explain
   these differences and to provide insight on how patenting is used in
   SMEs. The patent competence was low among the studied SMEs, and internal
   patent resources were found to be important for effective and efficient
   use of the patent system, for application as well as monitoring and
   enforcement. While of limited perceived importance for protecting
   inventions in entrepreneurial SMEs, patents were used to attract
   customers and venture capital, which is of utmost importance for the
   survival and growth of these firms. Thus, patenting has an important
   role to play even in firms where the protective function of patents is
   secondary.}},

   willingness to patent and encouraging the patenting behavior within the
   firm. Monitoring the R\&D process in intellectual property right (IPR)
   management, such as proposal and outcome evaluation, is less influential
   in fostering manufacturing firms to patent. One implication emerged from

Abstract = {{This paper examines a number of forces that have possibly contributed to

   review of previous hypotheses and conventional wisdom, this study
   proposes an additional explanation and argues that patent subsidy
   programs implemented by each provincial region have played an important
   role in the growth of Chinese patenting. This institutional change,
   taking place at the province-level, has induced an increase in patent
   propensity among not only firms, universities, and research institutes,
   but also individuals. Empirical evidence based on publicly available
   data provides solid support for this argument. It was also found that a
   larger fraction of applications are granted patent rights since the
   implementation of such programs, suggesting that reduction in patent
   application quality may not be a serious concern, unless the criteria
   used for patent examination have been lowered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   process. The comparison of patent systems in Europe, Japan, and the
   United States shows that their operational designs differ substantially:
   the European system provides higher-quality and more expensive
   examination services than the United States one, while the Japanese
   Patent system is in an intermediate position. The results illustrate
   that different system designs lead to different outcomes in terms of
   backlogs, patent propensity, and the number of dubious patent rights in
   force. In this respect, these findings (i) provide an empirical
   validation of the conjecture of a vicious cycle linking the quality of
   examination and demand for patents and (ii) highlight the need for a
   multifaceted convergence of patent systems before mutual recognition is
   put in place.}},

   effective in enhancing a firm's willingness to patent. In particular, we
   find that reward mechanisms can negatively moderate the effect of size

Abstract = {{This paper is based upon a survey on a regional sample of Italian
   inventors who, between 1991 and 2005, were named in patent applications
   filed at the European Patent Office. Their features and patenting
   activities are examined in relation to the size of their organizations.
   Compared to those from medium and large companies, the inventors working
   in small firms are less productive in terms of patent applications.
   However, according to different indicators, it emerges that there is no
   difference in the average quality of patented inventions of the two
   groups. Nevertheless, one-third of small applicants evaluates negatively
   its patenting experience, while this is true for only a tiny fraction of
   larger patentees. On the basis of further interviews, we find that these
   assessments are particularly influenced by the different capacity to
   enforce patent rights.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have explained the propensity to patent in industrial
   corporations. Larger companies are supposed to have a stronger tendency
   to protect their intellectual property through patents. Also, patents
   are related to industry, with chemicals and pharmaceuticals using them
   more frequently, and services industries less so. In the last 20 years,
   the rapidly growing software industry has greatly increased its tendency
   to patent. This study presents a statistical explanation of patenting in
   the US and Canadian (over 1700) publicly quoted computer
   software-producing companies, representing half of the world industry.
   We found that firm size, geographical clustering, and the mix of
   software products and services at firm level explain most of the

Abstract = {{A 1993 survey on the innovative activities of Europe's largest
   industrial firms obtained useable results on patenting activities for
   604 respondents. The data are used to calculate the sales-weighted
   propensity rates for 19 industries. The propensity rates equal the
   percentage of innovations for which a patent application is made. The
   propensity rates for product innovations average 35.9\%, varying between
   8.1\% in textiles and 79.2\% in pharmaceuticals. The average for process
   innovations is 24.8\%, varying from 8.1\% in textiles to 46.8\% for
   precision instruments. Only four sectors have patent propensity rates,
   for both product and process innovations combined, that exceed 50\%:
   pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and precision instruments.
   Regression results that control for the effect of industry sector show
   that patent propensity rates increase with firm size and are higher
   among firms that find patents to be an important method for preventing
   competitors from copying both product and process innovations. The
   effect of secrecy is not so straightforward. Firms that find secrecy to
   be an important protection method for product innovations are less
   likely to patent, as expected, but secrecy has little effect on the
   propensity to patent process innovations. The R\&D intensity of the firm
   has no effect on patent propensity rates for both product and process
   innovations. The sector of activity has a strong influence on product
   patent propensities but very little effect on process patent
   propensities, after controlling for the effect of other factors. (C)

Abstract = {{Patent databases contain a wealth of technical information, Dirt only a
   faction of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) use them
   as an information source. The characteristics of SMEs that use patent
   databases and the reasons why they do or do not use them are
   investigated in this study. Part of the analysis is based on the
   Community Innovation Survey results, which is the largest survey to date
   of innovative European firms. The results show, that the probability of
   using patent databases increases with firm size and is higher among
   firms that perform research and development or which find patents of
   value as an appropriation method. Furthermore, the percentage of firms
   in each of 14 sectors that find patents to be an important information
   source is correlated with the patent propensity rate In each sector, The
   second pair of the study is based on a combined survey and interview
   study of Dutch SMEs in five high-technology sectors. The results show
   that SMEs mainly use patent databases to acquire information, often for
   legal purposes, that is not available from any other source. In
   contrast, these databases are seldom used to acquire technical data,
   largely because of the cost in terms of personnel time and expertise.
   This points to the need for simpler and more efficient methods of seal
