Abstract = {{In Mexico during the protectionist economic regime a process of
   industrial modernization was carried out which led to the incorporation
   of different types of technologies into the structures and processes of
   production or consumption. The patent policy was implemented with the
   interest of encouraging the attraction of novel technologies, but their
   contribution was quite limited due to the nature, design and operation,
   with which it was conformed. Therefore, the patent policy did not drive
   patenting activity in a high and sustained manner. It was ineffective to
   contribute to the development of technologies generated by local actors,
   and marginally propitiated the productive exploitation of patents.}},

Abstract = {{What motivates university scientists to identify practical applications
   for their research results and consider having them patent-protected? A
   wealth of research points towards a complex blend of factors, including
   organizational antecedents, social norms and personal-level
   expectations. Few studies, however, have attempted to investigate the
   effect of concrete incentives from the perspective of individual
   scientists' decision-making. In this paper, we operationalize the
   propensity to patent and commercialize research results as the intention
   to submit an invention disclosure filing. We use scenario-based conjoint
   analysis to capture university scientists' preference structures for
   different incentive policies. Results indicate that direct and indirect
   financial incentives are dominant drivers. In addition, a grace period
   that would allow for patenting and publishing in parallel and the
   inclusion of patents in academic performance assessments are worth
   considering, whereas the specific setup of the technology transfer
   organization and public recognition of achievements in form of an award
   appear to have limited effect. However, preferences for incentives and
   hence their effectiveness vary significantly across academic disciplines
   and ranks as well as with scientists' working experience, patenting
   experience and research orientation. On this basis, we can derive more
   qualified recommendations for incentive system design.}},

Abstract = {{The process of technology commercialization involves numerous hurdles,
   from the original idea to its translation into the market. Patenting
   brings to light the research activities created through
   university-industry collaborations. This paper explores patent
   propensity, as related to commercializing innovative activities
   resulting from collaborations between universities and regional small
   and medium enterprises (SMEs). To achieve our aims, we apply a robust
   regression analysis to test five research hypotheses using firm-level
   data on 263 firms located in the Gwangju region of Korea. Our empirical
   results show that certain industry characteristics are negatively
   related to the propensity to patent. In addition, and contrary to
   expectations, it is found that the InnoBiz firms that the government
   designated as innovative SMEs are not performing any differently from
   general firms. It is only the CEO's academic credentials that are found
   to be positively related to propensity to patent. From the findings, we
   can conclude that patenting propensity is likely related to CEOs'
   managerial strategies rather than the particular characteristics of the
   technology in question. We also suggest new technology commercialization
   related with universities' policies and support to promote regional SMEs
   including conglomerated firms as well as universities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides new econometric evidence on the determinants of
   eco-innovations by using multiple innovation indicators and by combining
   survey-based information and patent records at the firm level from two
   different time periods. We hypothesize that firms with a propensity to
   patent focus on future technological and market opportunities and do not
   directly or immediately react to incentives created by environmental
   policies. Based on negative binomial models, we confirm that eco-patents
   are stimulated by the expectation of creating technological advancement
   and new market opportunities. By contrast, energy cost savings can
   better or more easily be achieved when firms refrain from patenting and
   concentrate on non-patented innovations or adoption. Favorable framework
   conditions created by environmental policies and patent protection are
   also important for eco-patenting, but more in the longer term. Testing
   the validity of using self-reported eco-innovations, instead of patents,
   as the dependent variable in simple binomial probit models reveals that
   product eco-innovations as reported in the surveys are a relatively good
   proxy for eco-patents. Yet, for product eco-innovations, serving and
   enlarging current markets is another important reason to innovate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides new evidence of innovation processes in family firms
   by investigating their attitude toward the protection of innovation
   outputs. More specifically, the main objective is to understand, through
   the SEW (Socioemotional Wealth) lens, whether innovative family firms
   tend to use patents as a tool for protecting intellectual property.
   Based on a sample of 229 Italian companies that make R\&D investments,
   our analysis highlights that degree of alignment with the family
   business model is a significant predictor of a firm's attitude toward
   protecting innovation with patents, even though not all of the
   dimensions of a family business have the same effect. When disentangling
   the effect of three different indicators (i.e., family ownership, family
   governance and the presence of young successors), family involvement in
   the board of directors is a negative significant driver, the presence of
   young successors is a positive driver, and ownership has no effect. (C)

Abstract = {{Inventions have long been recognized as key driver for wealth creation
   of nations. As intellectual property (IP) rights are costly and
   difficult to acquire and enforce, it is often argued that SMEs are
   disadvantaged in their ability to utilize IP rights. Against the
   background of the patent upsurge, we first conduct a literature review
   of the role of patenting and alternative instruments to protect
   intellectual property. Secondly, the patent frequencies are analyzed
   based on statistics, and thirdly semi-structured interviews are used to
   provide an understanding of private inventors and SMEs IP rights
   utilization. The results of the study show that actions to support
   patenting in Finland and registering of other types IPR remains low. As
   propensity to patent using different routes, national first filings are
   declining for small countries like Finland as companies increasingly use
   PCT, and other alternative routes. Interviews with private inventors and
   SMEs show, that the general knowledge of the global patent system, and
   capabilities to operate with IPRs, are quite modest. This leads to
   unjustified high expectations of economic benefits of patenting, and
   eventually, disappointment with IPRs. Reasons for this development, and
   challenges to the Finnish national patenting support environment are
   discussed. We derive some possible challenges for future patent policies
   from these insights.}},

Title = {{Exploring the use of patents in a weak institutional environment: The
   effects of innovation partnerships, firm ownership, and new management
   practices}},
Journal = {{TECHNOVATION}},

Volume = {{45-46}},

Abstract = {{Most observations of the patent behavior of firms are derived from
   institutional environments in which relatively strong protection can be
   obtained, even if patents per se are imperfect protection mechanisms. As
   a result, the determinants of a firm's propensity to patent in a weak
   appropriability regime are still unclear. This paper advances our
   current understanding of patent behavior by exploring the effects of
   manufacturing firms' innovation partnerships, foreign ownership, and
   adoption of new management practices on the likelihood of patenting. Our
   analysis is based on the responses of firms to questions in the
   Brazilian Industrial Survey of Technological Innovation (Pintec). The
   findings presented here indicate that, despite the weaknesses of the
   patent system, firms engaged in innovation-oriented collaborations are
   more likely to patent than firms not involved in these partnerships.
   Additionally, the results reveal that domestic and foreign firms in a
   weak institutional environment are similar in their inclination to
   patent. Finally, the empirical exercise shows that when a patent system
   is characterized by high levels of formalism and low levels of
   safeguarding against infringements of property rights firms adopt novel
   management practices as substitutes for patents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{It is well known that not all innovations are patented, but the exact

   systematically patented and unpatented innovations over the period
   1977-2004 across industrial sectors. The main data source is the `R\&D
   100 Awards' competition organized by the journal Research and
   Development. Since 1963, the magazine has been awarding this prize to
   the 100 most technologically significant new products available for sale
   or licensing in the year preceding the judgments. We match the products
   winners of the R\&D 100 awards competition with USPTO patents and we
   examine the variation of patent propensity across different contexts
   (industries, geographical areas and organizations). Finally we compare
   our findings with previous assessments of patent propensity based on

   large-scale brewing in this period showed both a self-aware culture of
   rapid technological innovation and a remarkably low propensity to
   patent. Our study records how brewery innovators pursued a wide variety
   of highly distinct appropriability strategies, including secrecy,
   selective revealing, open innovation and knowledge-sharing for
   reputational reasons, and patenting. All these strategies could
   co-exist, although some brewery insiders maintained a suspicion of the
   promoters of patent technologies, which faded only in the nineteenth
   century. Furthermore, we find evidence that sophisticated strategies of
   selective revealing could support trade in inventions even without the
   use of the patent system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an analysis of the impact of patent fees on the
   demand for patents. It presents a dataset of fees since 1980 at the
   European (EPO), the US and the Japanese patent offices. Descriptive
   statistics show that fees have severely decreased at the EPO over the
   1990s, converging towards the level of fees in the US and Japan. The
   estimation of dynamic panel data models suggests that the price
   elasticity of demand for patents is about -0.30. These results suggest
   that the laxity of fee policy at the EPO has significantly contributed
   to the rising propensity to patent.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at analyzing the fit, or matching, between
   technological goals that lead a firm to choose a particular
   technological partner and the impact of that partner on the firm's
   innovation performance. We hypothesize that, when designing their
   alliance strategy, firms take into account exploration or exploitation
   motivations. An adequate design of this strategy is critical because
   each technological partner will exert a different impact on firm's
   innovation outcomes. Using data from a representative panel of Spanish
   manufacturing firms comprising 1,300 firms across 5 years, we find that
   the motivation in forming alliances with vertical partners is to exploit
   existing competences which is reflected in an increased likelihood of
   obtaining product and process innovations. The main driver behind the
   selection of institutional partnerships, a type of collaboration which
   has a greater propensity to patent, is the exploration of new ideas.
   Finally, horizontal collaboration is motivated by the desire to carry
   out pre-competitive research, which explains the null impact of this
   type of alliance on innovation outcomes. The implications of these
   findings as they apply to management practice, economic policy and
   future research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades, innovations protected by patents have
   played a key role in business strategies. This fact enhanced studies of
   the determinants of patents and the impact of patents on innovation and
   competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantages is as important
   as creating them. Patents help sustaining competitive advantages by
   increasing the production cost of competitors, by signaling a better
   quality of products and by serving as barriers to entry. If patents are
   rewards for innovation, more R\&D should be reflected in more patent
   applications but this is not the end of the story. There is empirical
   evidence showing that patents through time are becoming easier to get
   and more valuable to the firm due to increasing damage awards from
   infringers. These facts question the constant and static nature of the
   relationship between R\&D and patents. Furthermore, innovation creates
   important knowledge spillovers due to its imperfect appropriability. Our
   paper investigates these dynamic effects using US patent data from 1979
   to 2000 with alternative model specifications for patent counts. We
   introduce a general dynamic count panel data model with dynamic
   observable and unobservable spillovers, which encompasses previous
   models, is able to control for the endogeneity of R\&D and therefore can
   be consistently estimated by maximum likelihood. Apart from allowing for
   firm specific fixed and random effects, we introduce a common unobserved
   component, or secret stock of knowledge, that affects differently the
   propensity to patent of each firm across sectors due to their different
   absorptive capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Foreign applications for Chinese patents have been growing by over 30\%
   a year. This paper explores two hypotheses in explaining the foreign

   foreign companies more deeply engaged with the Chinese economy, returns
   from protecting their intellectual property in China have increased. As
   domestic Chinese firms' ability to imitate foreign technology gains
   strength and competition between foreign firms intensifies in the
   Chinese market, such competitive threat creates an urgency for
   protecting intellectual property. Using a database that comprises
   China's State Intellectual Property Office patents and the U.S. Patent
   and Trademark Office patents, I find strong support for the competitive
   threat hypothesis. The estimates imply that competition between foreign
   firms in China can account for 36\% of the annual growth of foreign

Abstract = {{innovation plays a crucial role in determining today's economic growth
   patterns. But what enables some countries to innovate more than others?
   This study attempts to answer this question by analyzing in premiere a
   panel of sixteen Eastern European transition countries. It provides a
   detailed description of innovation identifying regional differences in
   terms of historical heritage, technological specialization, commitments
   and main actors involved in this process, before and after the fall of
   communism. Secondly, it explores empirically the main drivers of their
   innovative output, proxied by patents, using a variety of econometric
   techniques and control variables. The results confirm the crucial role
   of universities and existing national knowledge base complemented by
   R\&D commitments from both public and private sources. Policy measures,
   such as intellectual property rights protection or a favorable business
   climate, increase significantly the propensity to patent, while measures
   of transitional downturn and industrial restructuring diminish it.
   Finally, globalization contributes to developing new innovations in

Abstract = {{This paper investigates motivations for patenting and their impact on
   companies' propensity to patent. Amongst the main findings, the strong
   importance of exclusion motives must be emphasized. Irrespective Of the
   Country, the industry or the characteristics of the company, patenting
   in order to prevent imitation is the main reason for patenting, and this
   motivation strongly affects the propensity to patent. The patent system
   still performs its traditional mission to a large extent, Another major
   finding is the important role played by defensive patenting: companies
   patent in order to preserve their freedom of operation which, in turn,
   significantly impacts the propensity to patent. Finally, monetary
   motivations are found to be of particular interest to small, R\&D
   intensive companies, especially in the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals
   and computers industries, but only US companies actively patent for this
   reason.}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims to clarify the extent to which the results of
   scientific-oriented research conducted by corporations are reflected in
   their application-oriented research. Focusing on large Japanese
   manufacturers of electrical machinery, the paper analyses firm-level
   data on presentations of scientific papers that represent the results of
   scientific-oriented research activities, citations of scientific papers
   in patents, and inventions. The electrical machinery industry, a
   prototypical science-based industry, has been placing a growing emphasis
   on scientific-oriented research during the 1990's as is evident from
   trends in R\&D expenses, scientific papers, and inventions.
   Regression analysis results suggest a complementary relationship between
   citations of basic scientific knowledge as presented in scientific
   papers on the one hand and acts of invention on the other hand, in the
   sense that a rise in citations corresponds to a rise in inventions.
   Moreover, the results suggest that invention efficiency (number of
   patent claims per unit of R\&D expenditure) has been increasing during
   the 1990's. Furthermore, the results suggest that, given the exogenous
   influences on the patent system in Japan, it is necessary to include the
   number of patent claims when attempting to measure corporate technology
   development activity through the volume of patent applications. However,
   there was no finding of a clear relationship between the number of
   scientific papers and inventions. Implications of these results for
   corporate R\&D strategy are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have explained the propensity to patent in industrial
   corporations. Larger companies are supposed to have a stronger tendency
   to protect their intellectual property through patents. Also, patents
   are related to industry, with chemicals and pharmaceuticals using them
   more frequently, and services industries less so. In the last 20 years,
   the rapidly growing software industry has greatly increased its tendency
   to patent. This study presents a statistical explanation of patenting in
   the US and Canadian (over 1700) publicly quoted computer
   software-producing companies, representing half of the world industry.
   We found that firm size, geographical clustering, and the mix of
   software products and services at firm level explain most of the

   scientist's departure reduces the firm's R\&D expenditures and raises
   its propensity to patent an innovation. We find evidence from firm-level
   panel data that is consistent with this latter result. Our results
   suggest that scientists' turnover is associated with cross-industry
   patenting variation and with recent economy-wide increases in patenting.
   Scientists' turnover may also partly account for why small firms have

   applications by industrial firms, using data from the French survey on
   appropriation (EFAT). We build a two equations model including count and
   interval dependent variables and estimate it by asymptotic least
   squares. Controlling for the traditional determinants of innovation,
   like research and development expenditures, we find that patent
   disclosure is the main reason why firms do not patent all their
   innovations. Moreover, once we control for the differences in the
   propensity to patent, patent disclosure also reduces the number of
   patents applications. On the other hand, the will of firms to acquire a
   stronger position in technology negotiations and to avoid trials
   increases the number of patent applications.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the data of the first wave of the Mannheim Innovation panel,
   this paper explores the link between R\&D expenditures and patents. Our
   data allow a detailed analysis of the fin size distribution of R\&D and
   patent applications at different patent offices. it is shown that the
   share of R\&D performing firms is stictly increasing wih firm size. The
   share of firms applying for patents shows an even steeper increase with
   firm size. Moreover, large firms are more likely apply for patents in
   more than one country. The home patent office appears especially
   important for small firms. Using various count data models, the paper
   explores the relationship between R\&D and patents at the firm level. We
   carefully test several distributional assumptions for count data models.
   A negative binomial hurdle model seems to be the most appropriate count
   data model for our data as the decision to patent inventions and the
   productivity of R\&D are ruled by different mechanisms. Our estimates
   point towards significant returns to scale of R\&D. Furthermore, the
   empirical results can be interpreted towards minor and insignificant
   spillover effects. Even after controlling for a variety of firm
   characteristics, firm size exhibits a large effect on the propensity to
   patent.}},

Abstract = {{A 1993 survey on the innovative activities of Europe's largest
   industrial firms obtained useable results on patenting activities for
   604 respondents. The data are used to calculate the sales-weighted
   propensity rates for 19 industries. The propensity rates equal the
   percentage of innovations for which a patent application is made. The
   propensity rates for product innovations average 35.9\%, varying between
   8.1\% in textiles and 79.2\% in pharmaceuticals. The average for process
   innovations is 24.8\%, varying from 8.1\% in textiles to 46.8\% for
   precision instruments. Only four sectors have patent propensity rates,
   for both product and process innovations combined, that exceed 50\%:
   pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and precision instruments.
   Regression results that control for the effect of industry sector show
   that patent propensity rates increase with firm size and are higher
   among firms that find patents to be an important method for preventing
   competitors from copying both product and process innovations. The
   effect of secrecy is not so straightforward. Firms that find secrecy to
   be an important protection method for product innovations are less
   likely to patent, as expected, but secrecy has little effect on the
   propensity to patent process innovations. The R\&D intensity of the firm
   has no effect on patent propensity rates for both product and process
   innovations. The sector of activity has a strong influence on product
   patent propensities but very little effect on process patent
   propensities, after controlling for the effect of other factors. (C)
