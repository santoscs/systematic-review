AB  - The Schumpeterian hypothesis about the effect of firm size on research and development (R&D) output is studied for a sample of R&D projects for R&D-intensive firms that are small but have substantial variance in their sizes. Across the distribution of firm sizes, the elasticity of patenting with respect to R&D ranged from 0.41 to 0.55, with the elasticities being largest for intermediate levels of firm size and also varying directly with the extent to which the projects are Schumpeterian in the cost or value senses. The paper’s findings at the R&D project level are compared with the literature’s findings at the line of business, firm, and industry levels, and the findings are consistent with the literature’s findings for small firms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In Mexico during the protectionist economic regime a process of industrial modernization was carried out which led to the incorporation of different types of technologies into the structures and processes of production or consumption. The patent policy was implemented with the interest of encouraging the attraction of novel technologies, but their contribution was quite limited due to the nature, design and operation, with which it was conformed. Therefore, the patent policy did not drive patenting activity in a high and sustained manner. It was ineffective to contribute to the development of technologies generated by local actors, and marginally propitiated the productive exploitation of patents. © Instituto Figuerola, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, 2018

AB  - The present work characterizes and evaluates the behavior of patenting activity in Mexico during the industrial protectionist regime of 1940 to 1970 and the economic liberalization regime between 1995 and 2015. In order to carry out a contrasting analysis between periods patent data are grouped by technological sectors according to the International Patent Classification (IPC), which allows for consistent analyzes in a temporal or spatial manner. The comparison of the evolution and structures of patenting between periods suggests, in the aggregation area exposed, a continuity in the direction of the propensity to patent both resident and non-resident holders in the determined technological fields. This shows that the technological development of the country has maintained the same pattern during both economic regimes. © 2018 America Latina en la Historia Economica. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper is motivated by recent findings about family firms (FFs) ability to ‘do more with less’ in the innovation process, which we dub ‘lean innovation’. We consider lean innovation patenting strategies in an emerging market context that is undergoing improvement in its intellectual property protection (IPP) regime. Grounded in upper echelons theory we expect that the initiation of an intra-family succession will lead to generational shift in a FFs approach to IPP, as evinced in its patenting strategy. Applying a difference in difference methodology we are able to compare FFs who have undertaken an intra-family succession with FFs who have not yet initiated a succession process. Further, we consider the second difference as a strategy change between the pre-and post-succession period thereby isolating the effects of the post-succession change on patenting strategy. We also distinguish between different patent types (invention, utility, and design), and consider FF propensity to patent, and patent conversion rates. Based on generational differences between founders and successors we find successors are significant adopters of lean innovation patenting strategies. We add to the sparse literature on succession in emerging market FFs and contribute to improved understandings of long-term FF strategic adaptation in a dynamic institutional landscape. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The process of technology commercialization involves numerous hurdles, from the original idea to its translation into the market. Patenting brings to light the research activities created through university-industry collaborations. This paper explores patent propensity, as related to commercializing innovative activities resulting from collaborations between universities and regional small and medium enterprises (SMEs). To achieve our aims, we apply a robust regression analysis to test five research hypotheses using firm-level data on 263 firms located in the Gwangju region of Korea. Our empirical results show that certain industry characteristics are negatively related to the propensity to patent. In addition, and contrary to expectations, it is found that the InnoBiz firms that the government designated as innovative SMEs are not performing any differently from general firms. It is only the CEO's academic credentials that are found to be positively related to propensity to patent. From the findings, we can conclude that patenting propensity is likely related to CEOs' managerial strategies rather than the particular characteristics of the technology in question. We also suggest new technology commercialization related with universities' policies and support to promote regional SMEs including conglomerated firms as well as universities. © 2017 by the author.

AB  - This paper provides new econometric evidence on the determinants of eco-innovations by using multiple innovation indicators and by combining survey-based information and patent records at the firm level from two different time periods. We hypothesize that firms with a propensity to patent focus on future technological and market opportunities and do not directly or immediately react to incentives created by environmental policies. Based on negative binomial models, we confirm that eco-patents are stimulated by the expectation of creating technological advancement and new market opportunities. By contrast, energy cost savings can better or more easily be achieved when firms refrain from patenting and concentrate on non-patented innovations or adoption. Favorable framework conditions created by environmental policies and patent protection are also important for eco-patenting, but more in the longer term. Testing the validity of using self-reported eco-innovations, instead of patents, as the dependent variable in simple binomial probit models reveals that product eco-innovations as reported in the surveys are a relatively good proxy for eco-patents. Yet, for product eco-innovations, serving and enlarging current markets is another important reason to innovate. © 2016 Newcastle University.

AB  - The 1714 Longitude Act created the Board of Longitude to administer a large monetary prize and progress payments for the precise determination of a ship's longitude. However, the prize did not prohibit patenting. We use a new dataset of marine chronometer inventors to show that the propensity to patent was high. We argue that while the prize spurred entry by key inventors, and progress payments facilitated research investment in an area of significant social value, patents promoted disclosure. Our findings highlight the importance of complementarities between prize and patent-based incentives in the design of innovation inducement contests. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Inventions have long been recognized as key driver for wealth creation of nations. As intellectual property (IP) rights are costly and difficult to acquire and enforce, it is often argued that SMEs are disadvantaged in their ability to utilize IP rights. Against the background of the patent upsurge, we first conduct a literature review of the role of patenting and alternative instruments to protect intellectual property. Secondly, the patent frequencies are analyzed based on statistics, and thirdly semi-structured interviews are used to provide an understanding of private inventors and SMEs IP rights utilization. The results of the study show that actions to support patenting in Finland and registering of other types IPR remains low. As propensity to patent using different routes, national first filings are declining for small countries like Finland as companies increasingly use PCT, and other alternative routes. Interviews with private inventors and SMEs show, that the general knowledge of the global patent system, and capabilities to operate with IPRs, are quite modest. This leads to unjustified high expectations of economic benefits of patenting, and eventually, disappointment with IPRs. Reasons for this development, and challenges to the Finnish national patenting support environment are discussed. We derive some possible challenges for future patent policies from these insights. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

AB  - Overview This chapter discusses how patent data can be used to provide additional information about the structure and commercialization of food safety research. Although, historically, a great deal of the research evaluating the impact of science has relied on the study of patents (1, 2), this is not the case in food safety. Experts participating in the workshop entitled “Assessing the Public Value of Government-Funded University-Based Research on Food Safety,” described in Chapter 2, pointed out that patents are not the primary output of food safety research and development; hence the goals of this chapter are limited to addressing the following questions: (1) What has happened to the pace and direction of patenting in the food safety sector? (2) What are the characteristics of US and foreign firms that are most active in food safety patenting? (3) What are the geographical and sectoral distribution of food safety patents? This chapter provides new ways of answering these questions for two reasons. The first is the use of a new data set from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that provides detailed information about patents, inventors, and firms. The second is the application of the text analysis techniques discussed in Chapter 4 to patent data – these techniques permit the identification of food safety patents in the same way that food safety awards were identified in earlier chapters. Background Although patents are widely used as a measure of innovation, they are not a perfect indicator for a number of reasons. All innovations are not necessarily patented, and patents do not necessarily lead to the commercialization of a product or process. There are variations in the propensity to patent across firms and sectors due to different market sizes and examination processes. A company could be strategically reluctant to file patent applications because it wants to hide its activities from its competitors. Once the technology has matured enough to dominate its competitors, the company may at that point file patent applications. Given that the food safety industry spans a wide variety of sectors, the importance of patents could also vary depending on a firm's need to protect itself against imitators. For example, Fanfani et al. showed that patents related to agriculture and food industries in Italy are only one aspect of food industry innovations (3). © Cambridge University Press 2018.

AB  - This paper provides new evidence of innovation processes in family firms by investigating their attitude toward the protection of innovation outputs. More specifically, the main objective is to understand, through the SEW (Socioemotional Wealth) lens, whether innovative family firms tend to use patents as a tool for protecting intellectual property. Based on a sample of 229 Italian companies that make R&D investments, our analysis highlights that degree of alignment with the family business model is a significant predictor of a firm's attitude toward protecting innovation with patents, even though not all of the dimensions of a family business have the same effect. When disentangling the effect of three different indicators (i.e., family ownership, family governance and the presence of young successors), family involvement in the board of directors is a negative significant driver, the presence of young successors is a positive driver, and ownership has no effect. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modern growth theory puts invention on the center stage. Inventions are created by individuals, raising the question of whether we can increase the number of inventors. To answer this question, we study the causal effect of MSc engineering education on invention, using data on U.S. patents' Finnish inventors and the distance to the nearest technical university as an instrument. We find a positive effect of engineering education on the propensity to patent and a negative OLS bias. Our counterfactual calculation suggests that establishing three new technical universities resulted in a 20% increase in the number of USPTO patents by Finnish inventors. © 2016 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of Ecuadorian innovation support programs, which are intended to enhance firms' technological and managerial capabilities, on firms' innovative behavior and performance. In order to estimate the causal effects, we employ different Propensity Score Matching procedures. Results indicate that participating in a program increases firms' internal R&D and innovation effort, the qualification of the workforce, the likelihood of introducing product, process and organizational innovations and the probability of establishing linkages with research partners. However, participants do not show greater external R&D intensity or a higher propensity to patent, nor are they more likely to cooperate with suppliers, customer or competitors. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We distinguish between two firm patenting behaviors ('never patent' and 'always patent') and present a two-factor (capability and willingness) patenting behavior framework to enrich existing research. We examine innovative activities on 165 Taiwanese information and communication technology firms by using a zero-inflated Poisson regression model. Our results suggest that determinants of increasing probability of patenting are not completely the same as ones of decreasing probability of not patenting. Moreover, while capability factors are positively associated with propensity to patent, willingness factors moderate the relationship between capability factors and propensity to patent. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Managing patents is a core issue in the intellectual property management (IPM) of the firms. It entails two important activities: the patenting of new innovations and the renewal of patents. With the research on renewal data gaining momentum, this paper tries to study the renewal of patents in the pharma sector in India. Adopting a unique approach of studying both active and ceased patents of non-resident applicants in India, with the aid of descriptive methods and statistical tools as SPSS following trends, has been found. Business firms are the dominant patentees and single inventorship an emerging trend in India. While renewal patterns are quite applicant category specific, grant period is independent of the applicant category. In case of the patents category (ceased or active), maintenance duration is independent of the number of inventors but effective life of the patents varies with category of patents. The higher propensity to patent and maintenance show linkage with specific technology fields and the portfolio size. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Most observations of the patent behavior of firms are derived from institutional environments in which relatively strong protection can be obtained, even if patents per se are imperfect protection mechanisms. As a result, the determinants of a firm's propensity to patent in a weak appropriability regime are still unclear. This paper advances our current understanding of patent behavior by exploring the effects of manufacturing firms' innovation partnerships, foreign ownership, and adoption of new management practices on the likelihood of patenting. Our analysis is based on the responses of firms to questions in the Brazilian Industrial Survey of Technological Innovation (Pintec). The findings presented here indicate that, despite the weaknesses of the patent system, firms engaged in innovation-oriented collaborations are more likely to patent than firms not involved in these partnerships. Additionally, the results reveal that domestic and foreign firms in a weak institutional environment are similar in their inclination to patent. Finally, the empirical exercise shows that when a patent system is characterized by high levels of formalism and low levels of safeguarding against infringements of property rights firms adopt novel management practices as substitutes for patents. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using the four biotechnology uses and development surveys of Statistics Canada, we analyse the importance of collaboration, funding and support, as well as contracting, R&D and IP strategies on the propensity to patent of Canadian biotechnology firms. Our model accounts for the potential endogeneity due to the simultaneity of some of these strategies. Controlling for various firm characteristics, the stage of development of the firm and the sources of its revenues, we find that collaboration with other firms does matter for patenting, as well as R&D, even when controlling for potential endogeneity. IP strategies and contracting out activities also increase the propensity of a firm to patent, and so does angel and venture capital funding. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Using population-wide data on inventors and their demographic characteristics, the paper analyzes trends and patterns by technologies in age, the level of education, and gender gap. We find that the education level of inventors has risen over time. We also find that the gender gap is closing but at slower pace than in other comparable areas of society. Much to our surprise, the average age of inventors has been falling in all areas, despite rising levels of education. To explain the latter finding, we suggest three mechanisms as alternatives to the burden of knowledge argument: 1) the burden of dynamic knowledge renewal, 2) new technological opportunities, and 3) a generally increased propensity to patent. We discuss policy and managerial implications of our findings. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - This paper examines the role of public and private R&D spillovers and other determinants on the propensity to patent (whether firms engage in patenting activity) and patenting output (the number of patent applications). Knowledge spillovers are constructed based on the research profiles of businesses and public research institutions, respectively. We find that both private and public spillovers have an impact on patenting behaviour, though in opposite directions. Spillovers from business R&D have a negative impact, potentially reflecting adverse effects of rival firms' R&D on expected returns of own patenting activity. In contrast, public spillovers are found to have a positive effect on patenting activity, possibly reflecting the value to firms' patenting activity of basic and applied research conducted by public research institutes.

AB  - This article provides a decision framework on the practice of engineering management regarding protection of product and process innovation through patents. It studies the influence that the innovation effort of a company and degree of codification of the innovations has on the propensity to patent. Additionally, we analyze how the sector that the company is engaged in and the type of innovation affect these relationships. The conclusions indicate that both the innovation effort of a company and the degree of codification of the innovations have a positive influence on this propensity, and that this influence is greater in some sectors of activity and also is greater for product and radical innovations. © 2013 by the American Society for Engineering Management.

AB  - This article explores whether the heterogeneous costs of disclosure induced by patenting can serve as an explanation for the empirically observed heterogeneity of the propensity to patent across firms. A theoretical model identifies the interplay between market entry barriers and the usefulness of the information disclosed through patenting for competitors as a crucial factor driving the extent of disclosure costs that a patenting firm faces. High costs of disclosure may outweigh the merits of patenting, leading innovators to rely on alternative protection strategies, such as secrecy. An empirical investigation using the German part of the CIS data provides evidence for these theoretical predictions. © Oxford University Press 2013. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between patents, appropriability strategies, and market for technology in the English brewing industry before 1850. Previous research has pointed to the apparent paradox that large-scale brewing in this period showed both a self-aware culture of rapid technological innovation and a remarkably low propensity to patent. Our study records how brewery innovators pursued a wide variety of highly distinct appropriability strategies, including secrecy, selective revealing, open innovation and knowledge-sharing for reputational reasons, and patenting. All these strategies could co-exist, although some brewery insiders maintained a suspicion of the promoters of patent technologies, which faded only in the nineteenth century. Furthermore, we find evidence that sophisticated strategies of selective revealing could support trade in inventions even without the use of the patent system. © 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College.

AB  - We investigated the factors influencing an academic's propensity to patent and the quality of patenting in nanotechnology and biotechnology. We found that a university researcher is more likely to be listed as an inventor of a patented innovation, regardless of the assignee, if he receives private funding, has a fairly high level of cliquishness in the scientific network and has shown a prior capacity to successfully collaborate with industry, a concept that we named innovation loops. Furthermore, citation rate and number of claims, which are used to represent patent quality, are influenced by factors similar to those explaining patent quantity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Confronting patent applications to a 'true' measure of innovative output in the German CIS, the chapter concludes that patent applications are mainly done by innovators that develop new (physical) goods. Compared to goods innovators, service and process innovators show quite poor patenting rates. Collaboration with universities increases the propensity to patent, while collaboration with other partners does not. An innovator's orientation to local and national markets reduces, while international market orientation increases the probability of applying for patents. The estimates suggest dividing industries into two classes: high versus low patent propensity industries. Low patent propensity industries include all services industries as well as most traditional manufacturing industries. The probabilities estimated might give a clue to users of patent databases about the extent of their measurement bias when using patents as an innovation indicator. Especially service oriented innovations may not be equally captured by patent data. © Oxford University Press 2012. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents evidence that firms face a trade-off between the quantity and the quality of their research output. The econometric analysis uses survey data on patent applicants at the European Patent Office and addresses the identification problem caused by differences in firms' propensity to patent. The existence of a trade-off emphasizes the need to take the quality of research output into account when assessing research productivity. It also raises questions about the optimal quantity-quality mix that firms should target. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well known that not all innovations are patented, but the exact volume of innovative activities undertaken outside the coverage of patent protection and, relatedly, the actual propensity to patent an innovation in different contexts remain, to a major degree, a matter of speculation. This paper presents an exploratory study comparing systematically patented and unpatented innovations over the period 1977-2004 across industrial sectors. The main data source is the 'R&D 100 Awards' competition organized by the journal Research and Development. Since 1963, the magazine has been awarding this prize to the 100 most technologically significant new products available for sale or licensing in the year preceding the judgments. We match the products winners of the R&D 100 awards competition with USPTO patents and we examine the variation of patent propensity across different contexts (industries, geographical areas and organizations). Finally we compare our findings with previous assessments of patent propensity based on several sources of data. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluctuations in patenting frequency and propensity to patent have caught increasing interest, not the least since the emergence of a worldwide pro-patent era. In this paper, fluctuations in Swedish patent frequency are described and analysed, based on statistics and questionnaire survey studies among large and small patentees as well as among IP consultancy firms, complemented with interviews. The results confirm the importance of size of R&D and size of patenting resources for both large and small firms and for both positive and negative growth of patenting. In addition, some new determinants were found, of which some also discriminated between large and small firms. A shift to more quality-oriented patenting strategies with more selective patenting led to decreased patenting propensity and frequency, especially among large firms. As to propensity to patent using different routes, national first filings are declining in the longer run on average for small countries like Sweden and Finland, as especially large companies internationalise their IP operations and increasingly use the PCT route.

AB  - This paper provides an analysis of the impact of patent fees on the demand for patents. It presents a dataset of fees since 1980 at the European (EPO), the US and the Japanese patent offices. Descriptive statistics show that fees have severely decreased at the EPO over the 1990s, converging towards the level of fees in the US and Japan. The estimation of dynamic panel data models suggests that the price elasticity of demand for patents is about -0.30. These results suggest that the laxity of fee policy at the EPO has significantly contributed to the rising propensity to patent. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, 2011.

AB  - The 1883 Patents Act in Britain provides perspective for modern patent policy reforms because it radically changed incentives for inventors by reducing filing fees by 84 percent. Patents increased 2.5-fold after the reform, which was evenly distributed across the geography of inventors, the organization of invention and sectors. By realizing a large demand for cheaper patents the reform increased the propensity to patent and shifted inventive activity inside the patent system. It did not increase innovation as measured by changes in the distribution of high and low value patents and citations to English inventor patents in the United States. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Matching 2,777 R&D firms in surveys conducted by the National Research Council between 1921 and 1938 with U.S. patents reveals that 59 percent of all firms and 88 percent of publicly traded firms patented. These shares are much higher than those observed for modern R&D firms. Industry, firm size and the location of R&D facilities relative to major cities are shown to be important determinants of the propensity to patent. The effect of these factors remained constant across the 1920s and the Depression years suggesting that the tradeoff between patent disclosure and secrecy did not change over time. © 2011, The Economic History Association.

AB  - This study is aimed at analyzing the fit, or matching, between technological goals that lead a firm to choose a particular technological partner and the impact of that partner on the firm's innovation performance. We hypothesize that, when designing their alliance strategy, firms take into account exploration or exploitation motivations. An adequate design of this strategy is critical because each technological partner will exert a different impact on firm's innovation outcomes. Using data from a representative panel of Spanish manufacturing firms comprising 1,300 firms across 5 years, we find that the motivation in forming alliances with vertical partners is to exploit existing competences which is reflected in an increased likelihood of obtaining product and process innovations. The main driver behind the selection of institutional partnerships, a type of collaboration which has a greater propensity to patent, is the exploration of new ideas. Finally, horizontal collaboration is motivated by the desire to carry out pre-competitive research, which explains the null impact of this type of alliance on innovation outcomes. The implications of these findings as they apply to management practice, economic policy and future research are discussed. © 2011 European Academy of Management.

AB  - This paper extends the research on the R&D-patent relationship by distinguishing the factors affecting R&D productivity (which is defined as 'efficiency parameters') from the factors associated with the propensity of firms to patent, and estimates the impacts of the factors on innovative output. A data set from 1255 firms with nonzero R&D expenditures in Korea was studied, and the results show that efficiency parameters such as in-depth patent searches and revenue splitting policy for employee-inventors influence firm's innovative output through 'R&D productivity' effect. These results mean that we can improve firm's innovation output by changing efficiency parameters through a firm's investment or government support in a relatively short period. © 2011 eContent Management.

AB  - During the past two decades, innovations protected by patents have played a key role in business strategies. This fact enhanced studies of the determinants of patents and the impact of patents on innovation and competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantages is as important as creating them. Patents help sustaining competitive advantages by increasing the production cost of competitors, by signaling a better quality of products and by serving as barriers to entry. If patents are rewards for innovation, more R&D should be reflected in more patent applications but this is not the end of the story. There is empirical evidence showing that patents through time are becoming easier to get and more valuable to the firm due to increasing damage awards from infringers. These facts question the constant and static nature of the relationship between R&D and patents. Furthermore, innovation creates important knowledge spillovers due to its imperfect appropriability. Our paper investigates these dynamic effects using US patent data from 1979 to 2000 with alternative model specifications for patent counts. We introduce a general dynamic count panel data model with dynamic observable and unobservable spillovers, which encompasses previous models, is able to control for the endogeneity of R&D and therefore can be consistently estimated by maximum likelihood. Apart from allowing for firm specific fixed and random effects, we introduce a common unobserved component, or secret stock of knowledge, that affects differently the propensity to patent of each firm across sectors due to their different absorptive capacity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Foreign applications for Chinese patents have been growing by over 30% a year. This paper explores two hypotheses in explaining the foreign patenting surge in China: market covering and competitive threat. With foreign companies more deeply engaged with the Chinese economy, returns from protecting their intellectual property in China have increased. As domestic Chinese firms' ability to imitate foreign technology gains strength and competition between foreign firms intensifies in the Chinese market, such competitive threat creates an urgency for protecting intellectual property. Using a database that comprises China's State Intellectual Property Office patents and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office patents, I find strong support for the competitive threat hypothesis. The estimates imply that competition between foreign firms in China can account for 36% of the annual growth of foreign patenting in China. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Contrary to an accepted wisdom, this paper shows that cross-country variations in the number of patents per researcher do not only reflect differences in the propensity to patent but also signals differences in research productivity. We put forward and test an empirical model that formally accounts for the productivity and the propensity component of the R&D-patent relationship. The two components play an important role, as witnessed by the impact of several policies, including education, intellectual property and science and technology policies. Indicators based on domestic priority filings reflect research efforts and are primarily affected by varying propensities to patent. In contrast, international filings, especially triadic patents, rather capture variations in research productivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Innovation plays a crucial role in determining today's economic growth patterns. But what enables some countries to innovate more than others? This study attempts to answer this question by analyzing in premiere a panel of sixteen Eastern European transition countries. It provides a detailed description of innovation identifying regional differences in terms of historical heritage, technological specialization, commitments and main actors involved in this process, before and after the fall of communism. Secondly, it explores empirically the main drivers of their innovative output, proxied by patents, using a variety of econometric techniques and control variables. The results confirm the crucial role of universities and existing national knowledge base complemented by R&D commitments from both public and private sources. Policy measures, such as intellectual property rights protection or a favorable business climate, increase significantly the propensity to patent, while measures of transitional downturn and industrial restructuring diminish it. Finally, globalization contributes to developing new innovations in these countries through inflows of foreign investment and trade. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patent-based indicators at the country level are frequently used to assess countries' innovation performances or efforts. Yet they are often said to reflect the propensity to patent rather than actual research productivity. The authors of this article argue that patent-based indicators can rightfully be used to measure research productivity, as witnessed by the influence of several policy tools on the R&D-patent relationship. They also put forward a new counting methodology, less subject to "home" bias. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

AB  - This research investigates the relationship between organizational resources and innovation. Using a financial measure of liquidity, the quick ratio, and a patent-based innovation index, this study extends earlier research that has suggested that the relationship between organizational slack and innovation may be best represented as an inverted U-shape. Our study did find the relationship to be curvilinear, to be relatively stable across time periods, but more asymptotic, reflective of a diminishing returns phenomenon. Results also show the relationship to be moderated by industries' propensity to patent. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research and managerial practice.

AB  - The paper aims to clarify the extent to which the results of scientific-oriented research conducted by corporations are reflected in their application-oriented research. Focusing on large Japanese manufacturers of electrical machinery, the paper analyses firm-level data on presentations of scientific papers that represent the results of scientific-oriented research activities, citations of scientific papers in patents, and inventions. The electrical machinery industry, a prototypical science-based industry, has been placing a growing emphasis on scientific-oriented research during the 1990's as is evident from trends in R&D expenses, scientific papers, and inventions. Regression analysis results suggest a complementary relationship between citations of basic scientific knowledge as presented in scientific papers on the one hand and acts of invention on the other hand, in the sense that a rise in citations corresponds to a rise in inventions. Moreover, the results suggest that invention efficiency (number of patent claims per unit of R&D expenditure) has been increasing during the 1990's. Furthermore, the results suggest that, given the exogenous influences on the patent system in Japan, it is necessary to include the number of patent claims when attempting to measure corporate technology development activity through the volume of patent applications. However, there was no finding of a clear relationship between the number of scientific papers and inventions. Implications of these results for corporate R&D strategy are examined. © Springer-Verlag/Akadémiai Kiadó 2006.

AB  - Several studies have explained the propensity to patent in industrial corporations. Larger companies are supposed to have a stronger tendency to protect their intellectual property through patents. Also, patents are related to industry, with chemicals and pharmaceuticals using them more frequently, and services industries less so. In the last 20 years, the rapidly growing software industry has greatly increased its tendency to patent. This study presents a statistical explanation of patenting in the US and Canadian (over 1700) publicly quoted computer software-producing companies, representing half of the world industry. We found that firm size, geographical clustering, and the mix of software products and services at firm level explain most of the propensity to patent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We develop and test a model of the patenting and R&D decisions of an innovating firm whose scientist-employees sometimes quit to join or start a rival. In our model, the innovating firm patents to protect Itself from its employees. We show theoretically that the risk of a scientist's departure reduces the firm's R&D expenditures and raises its propensity to patent an innovation. We find evidence from firm-level panel data that is consistent with this latter result. Our results suggest that scientists ' turnover is associated with cross-industry patenting variation and with recent economy-wide increases in patenting. Scientists' turnover may also partly account for why small firms have high patent-R&D ratios. Copyright © 2005, RAND.

AB  - We analyse a firm's propensity to patent, using a new indicator of innovative output. We find that a firm's propensity to patent is significantly higher among R&D collaborators, and it varies across sectors and by firm size. With a given innovation output, smaller innovators have a lower probability of applying for a patent. Smaller innovators that do apply for patents, however, tend to have higher numbers of patent applications than larger firms. The results have obvious consequences for the interpretation of patenting figures as an indicator of innovation. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A 1993 survey on the innovative activities of Europe's largest industrial firms obtained useable results on patenting activities for 604 respondents. The data are used to calculate the sales-weighted propensity rates for 19 industries. The propensity rates equal the percentage of innovations for which a patent application is made. The propensity rates for product innovations average 35.9%, varying between 8.1% in textiles and 79.2% in pharmaceuticals. The average for process innovations is 24.8%, varying from 8.1% in textiles to 46.8% for precision instruments. Only four sectors have patent propensity rates, for both product and process innovations combined, that exceed 50%: pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machinery, and precision instruments. Regression results that control for the effect of industry sector show that patent propensity rates increase with firm size and are higher among firms that find patents to be an important method for preventing competitors from copying both product and process innovations. The effect of secrecy is not so straightforward. Firms that find secrecy to be an important protection method for product innovations are less likely to patent, as expected, but secrecy has little effect on the propensity to patent process innovations. The R&D intensity of the firm has no effect on patent propensity rates for both product and process innovations. The sector of activity has a strong influence on product patent propensities but very little effect on process patent propensities, after controlling for the effect of other factors. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper focuses on the scientific output of small and medium sized firms in high tech industries in the U.S. The indicators for technological output have been defined differently by different researchers. Economists have used patents as the measure of research and development (R&D) output, partly because they are easier to delineate than other indicators. Behavioral researchers interested in the R&D management process have relied on publications as a surrogate measure for R&D output, while research in science policy and innovation has focused on products and processes as indicators of innovation and technical output. There has not been any consensus about the validity of the different measures. It has been argued that the propensity to patent differs from industry to industry. The incentive to patent is dependent on how well patent can be used to protect the interests of the firms. This paper has focused on all three measures as indicators of R&D output and investigated the interrelationship among them as well as the correlates for these output. Except for the chemical industry, R&D expenditure is closely related with size as measured by annual sales, rather than the net income. It is observed that a growing firm is more likely to spend proportionately more money in R&D. The three output measures, patents, papers, and new products, are correlated, but the pattern of relationship is different in different industries. This means that technical behavior of the firms in different industries differs significantly. Correlates of patents, papers, and new products also differ in the different industries. It is interesting to note that a firm's growth is linked with new products in only some industries. Patent does not seem to have any effect on sales growth. The growth in R&D is not a factor leading to a higher level of scientific productivity. The important factor is the average level of R&D spending. The policy implication for this observation is that one ought to maintain a steady funding level of R&D instead of sudden changes in R&D budget. Consistency in R&D is important in determining higher level of scientific output. © 1990 IEEE

AB  - Estimation of a varying parameter model reveals that the trend of patents issued in England accelerated markedly in 1757. Similar results are obtained when patents are weighted by the number of production processes in which the patented invention may be used. There is no evidence that the rules or regulations regarding patents changed around 1757, and investigation of the propensity to patent in individual industries, and of the industrial distribution of patents, does not reveal a systematic change in the propensity to patent. Therefore, an acceleration in patentable invention must have caused the acceleration in patenting. The increase of the growth rate of patenting preceded an increase of the growth rate of total factor productivity, suggesting a causal relationship. Additionally, the fluctuation of patents around trend is much smaller after 1757, which reflects a widely based increase in patentable invention. Finally, the 1762 to 1851 period was characterized by an increased growth rate of patents and invention per person; England had entered her "Age of Invention.". © 1989.

AB  - For a sample of 24 chemical products, count data models are used to evaluate firms' propensity to patent and the link between patented process innovations and output prices. The results show that process patenting was largely an outgrowth of 'learning by doing'. Propensity to patent increased with firm size but decreased with market concentration. Reductions in output prices were strongly linked to learning by doing, and more weakly to the rate of patenting. Producer firms appear to have been more successful than non-producers in appropriating the value of patented process innovations. © 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - This paper analyzes the relationship between 1974 R&D expenditures and invention patenting by 4,274 narrowly-defined lines of business in 443 U.S. industrial corporations. The probability of non-zero patenting rose systematically with company-financed R&D outlays, as did the number of patents received. Within industries, patents tended most frequently to rise in proportion to R&D; among the exceptions, the tendency was toward diminishing returns. Variables measuring overseas sales, federal R&D support, diversification, scope of invention use, and invention type had only modest explanatory power. There was no significant evidence of disproportionate patent accumulation in the more highly concentrated industries. © 1983.

AB  - The increased patenting activity of foreign nationals in the United States has been a source of recent concern, and the fear has been expressed that the US is becoming relatively less technologically inventive. This paper investigates some possible causes of the increased foreign patenting activity and also briefly examines the determinants of patent filings by a country's own residents. The countries covered include: Canada, France, West Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Based on data on patent applications filed and some preliminary regression analysis, the paper finds that the rising foreign patenting activity in the US probably does not reflect increased foreign inventiveness vis-à-vis the US. However, foreign innovativeness may be increasing relative to the US. Over the period 1963 - 1974, the domestic patent base, measured by the number of patent applications filed by nationals in their home countries, has shown little change in any country except for Japan. Rather, multiple patent applications and a greater propensity to patent abroad, induced by the possibilities of exporting, appear to be the sources of the increase in foreign patent applications in the US and also in Japan. © 1978.
