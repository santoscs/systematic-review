Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine how different
   innovation patterns affect the financial performance of global
   technological firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors integrate the theories of
   innovation performance with those of Schumpeter's innovation patterns,
   namely, creative destruction and creative accumulation. Data spread over
   20 years is used to investigate the influence of innovation on the firm
   performance.
   Findings - Panel regression results indicate that, as compared to
   creative-destruction innovation, creative-accumulation patterns have a
   better firm performance, have a moderating effect on
   innovation-performance relationships, and have a better propensity to
   deal with difficult economic periods.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a scarcity of research that
   considers the effects of Schumpeterian patterns on innovation
   performance, especially ones dealing with the technology sector. Future
   work could consider other innovation variables (besides innovation
   patterns), as well as whether the results hold in other sectors.
   Practical implications - The findings indicate that in the tech-sector
   firms must continue to innovate.
   Originality/value - From the research perspective, the work integrates
   two streams of literature into a comprehensive model, and provides a
   holistic test for it. For tech-sector managers, the research provides
   one point of motivation for carrying out innovation even during a
   troubled economy.}},

Title = {{Patenting Activities and Firm Performance: Does Firm Size Matter?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Whereas prior research has provided valuable insights into the
   willingness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms
   to engage in patenting, a comparison of the performance implications of
   patenting activities across small and large firms is still lacking. This
   gap is important because SMEs and large firms, having different
   resources and capabilities, might benefit from patenting activities in
   different ways. In particular, SMEs can be expected to benefit less from
   patenting activities in terms of protection against imitators than large
   firms. On the other hand, the propensity and ability of SMEs to license
   out their patents and generate additional revenue streams might be
   relatively higher than that of their large counterparts. This paper
   studies the impact of patenting on licensing, innovation, and financial
   performance for both SMEs and large firms, using multiple-group path
   analyses on a sample of 358 manufacturing firms. Contrary to
   expectations, this study demonstrates that not only large firms, but
   also SMEs benefit from patenting in terms of commercializing product
   innovations. Moreover, for both SMEs and large firms, such increased
   innovation performance in turn contributes to higher profit margins.
   Patenting activities also increase the ability of SMEs and large firms
   to license out knowledge to external parties, and this positive effect
   is significantly stronger for large firms. However, neither in SMEs nor
   in large firms, these outward licensing activities generate short-term
   financial benefits. Finally, the study demonstrates that patenting
   activities do not trigger significant cost disadvantages for either SMEs
   or large firms. Jointly, these findings provide unique insights in the
   value-generating and cost-increasing effects of patenting, suggesting
   that not only large firms, but also SMEs should consider patenting as a
   viable strategy to fully reap commercial benefits from their innovation
   activities. At the same time, they temper open innovation scholars'
   expectations regarding the financial benefits of licensing out
   knowledge. Overall, these findings point to opportunities for optimizing
   the intellectual property management of both SMEs and large firms.}},

Abstract = {{Technology entrepreneurship is key to economic development. New
   technology ventures (NTVs) can have positive effects on employment and
   could rejuvenate industries with disruptive technologies. However, NTVs
   have a limited survival rate. In our most recent empirical study of
   11,259 NTVs established between 1991 and 2000 in the United States, we
   found that after four years only 36 percent, or 4,062, of companies with
   more than five full-time employees, had survived. After five years, the
   survival rate fell to 21.9 percent, leaving only 2,471 firms still in
   operation with more than five full-time employees. Thus, it is important
   to examine how new technology ventures can better survive. In the
   academic literature, a number of studies focus on success factors for
   NTVs. Unfortunately, empirical results are often controversial and
   fragmented. To get a more integrated picture of what factors lead to the
   success or failure of new technology ventures, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to examine the success factors in NTVs. We culled the
   academic literature to collect data from existing empirical studies.
   Using Pearson correlations as effect size statistics, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to analyze the findings of 31 studies and identified the
   24 most widely researched success factors for NTVs. After correcting for
   artifacts and sample size effects, we found that among the 24 possible
   success factors identified in the literature, 8 are homogeneous
   significant success factors for NTVs (i.e., they are homogeneous
   positive significant metafactors that are correlated to venture
   performance): (1) supply chain integration; (2) market scope; (3) firm
   age; (4) size of founding team; (5) financial resources; (6) founders'
   marketing experience; (7) founders' industry experience; and (8)
   existence of patent protection. Of the original 24 success factors, 5
   were not significant: (1) founders' research and development (R\&D)
   experience; (2) founders' experience with start-ups; (3) environmental
   dynamism; (4) environmental heterogeneity; and (5) competition
   intensity. The remaining 11 success factors are heterogeneous. For those
   heterogeneous success factors, we conducted a moderator analysis. Of
   this set, three appeared to be success factors, and two were failure
   factors for subgroups within the NTVs' population. To facilitate the
   development of a body of knowledge in technology entrepreneurship, this
   study also identifies high-quality measurement scales for future
   research. The article concludes with future research directions.}},
