Abstract = {{Using a panel data set based on repeated questionnaire surveys of
   Japanese start-up firms, this study examines the effects of numerical
   labor flexibility on the innovation outcomes of start-up firms, a topic
   on which there is currently insufficient research. Here, numerical labor
   flexibility is defined as the external labor turnover of regular
   employees and the proportion of non-regular employees, and innovation
   outcomes include product innovation and patent applications. The
   estimation results of a random-effects probit model indicate that an
   inverted U-shaped relationship exists between the external labor
   turnover of regular employees and the probability of patent
   applications. Moreover, a similar U-shaped relationship exists between
   the proportion of non-regular employees and the probability of product
   innovation. These results are interpreted in light of the organizational
   characteristics of start-up firms. The implications of the findings are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Analyzing the value of technology based on the differences of patent

Journal = {{SCIENTOMETRICS}},

Abstract = {{Patent applicants and examiners do not always have the same point of
   view when conducting a prior-art search. Although several studies have
   suggested differences between citations by applicants and examiners, the
   data and range of empirical studies are too incomplete to generalize the
   characteristics of relationships between citation types and the value of
   a technology or invention. To overcome this limitation, it is crucial to
   compare citations by applicants and by examiners in depth, with diverse
   perspectives and data, to determine the value of patent information for
   technological innovation. Thus, this paper suggests that the differences
   in the composition of technical information and patent quality in
   patent-level investigations as well as the locus of the knowledge source
   and knowledge recentness in knowledge-level investigations according to
   patent citation type (by applicants and examiners) reflect Pavitt's
   perspective on the nature, impact, and source of technological
   innovation. We found that the quality of patents cited by applicants is
   higher than that of those by examiners in four industries, excluding a
   supplier-dominated industry. The citation types are related to the locus
   of the knowledge source in four industries, excluding the
   supplier-dominated industry. In particular, the patents cited by
   examiners tended to be more recently issued in all sectoral fields. This
   research contributes to confirming the technological value of patents
   based on the citation behaviors of applicants and examiners through
   empirical analysis. The results can be utilized to investigate signals
   or noise in technological innovation and improve processes or systems of
   patent examination. In addition, it can help applicants conduct more
   thorough prior-art searches by comprehending the examiner's perspective
   toward citations to increase the probability of patent registration.}},

Abstract = {{For a company with Large long-term diversified equity investment
   (referred as ``equity-investment-oriented company{''}), consolidated
   earnings and cash flow cannot be all dominated by the parent company.
   However, parent company's own earnings and cash flow are the real basis
   of dividend payment. For this reason, the distribution of earnings and
   cash flow between the parent company and subsidiaries (referred as ``the
   distribution of liquidity{''}) should be considered in the decision of
   dividend policy. Study found that the dominant of diversified equity
   investment affect the distribution of liquidity; for listed companies
   with larger equity investment, subsidiaries tend to dominate more
   earnings and cash flow; subsidiaries dominating more earnings and cash
   flow usually tend to deliver less earnings and cash to parent company,
   resulting in a lower probability of patent company paying dividends to
   shareholders.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to propose an early precaution method which allows
   predicting probability of patent infringement as well as evaluating
   patent value. To obtain the purposes, a large-scale analysis on both
   litigated patents and non-litigated patents issued between 1976 and 2010
   by USPTO are conducted. The holistic scale analysis on the two types of
   patents (3,878,852 non-litigated patents and 31,992 litigated patents in
   total) issued by USPTO from 1976 to 2010 has not been conducted in
   literatures and need to be investigated to allow patent researchers to
   understand the overall picture of the USPTO patents. Also, by comparing
   characteristics of all litigated patents to that of non-litigated
   patents, a precaution method for patent litigation can be obtained. Both
   litigated patents and non-litigated patents are analyzed to understand
   the differences between the two types of patents in terms of different
   variables. It is found that there are statistically significant
   differences for the two types of patents in the following 11 variables:
   (1) No. of Assignee, (2) No. of Assignee Country, (3) No. of Inventor,
   (4) Inventor Country, (5) No. of Patent Reference, (6) No. of Patent
   Citation Received, (7) No. of IPC, (8) No. of UPC, (9) No. of Claim,
   (10) No. of Non-Patent Reference, and (11) No. of Foreign Reference.
   Finally, logistic regression is used for predicting the probability of
   occurrence of a patent litigation by fitting the 11 characteristics of
   3,910,844 USPTO patents to a logistic function curve.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the impact of public subsidies on private sector research and
   development (R\&D) activity for a sample of East German firms. Using
   propensity score matching, our empirical results indicate that
   subsidized firms indeed show a higher level of R\&D intensity (R\&D
   expenditures relative to total turnover) and a higher probability for
   patent application compared with non-subsidized firms. We find that, on
   average, the R\&D intensity increases from 1.5\% to 3.9\%. The
   probability of patent application rises from 20\% to 40\%. These results
   closely match earlier empirical findings for East Germany. Given the
   fact that the East German innovation system is particularly driven by
   small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we draw special attention to
   the effectiveness of R\&D subsidies for this latter subgroup. Here, no
   specific empirical evidence is available so far. Our findings indicate
   that policy effectiveness also holds for private R\&D activity of SMEs,
   with the highest increase in terms of R\&D intensity being estimated for
   microbusinesses with up to ten employees.}},
